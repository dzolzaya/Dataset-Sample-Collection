Parliament to stay on	On the evening of Friday 29th January the Mongolian Great State Khural (Parliament) met will full attendance to debate an important subject, namely the proposed dismissal of the Prime Minister and the Government. The debate lasted six hours - well into the night. The session began with a speech by A.Bakei, head of the State Structure Standing Committee in which he presented the outcome of their meeting, namely to keep the PM and the Government. The vote seems to have been tight: ten of the nineteen members of the committee voted against the proposal to dismiss Prime Minister (passed by 52.9%). Next the head of the Mongolian People’s Party (MMP) Group in Parliament, S.Byambatsogt, presented their unanimous decision to dismiss the PM. The debate was unique insofar as it was chaired by two speakers; first by Deputy Speaker S.Gonchigdorj and then from around 21.00 pm by Speaker Z.Enkhbold himself. This has not happened many times in the history of the Mongolian Parliament. Relating to the issue of the debate, a total of 57 MP’s pressed the button to ask a question; most, however, were simply making statements and giving their opinions than asking questions. As the debate went on President Elbegdorj himself entered the Parliament Hall and said: “I want to say how I think such a situation should be solved in the future. Let’s stop dismissing one Prime Minister and then leaving Parliament to search for a new one. It’s easy for 19 MP’s or more to collect signatures and request that the Prime Minister be dismissed – but in future they need to propose who the replacement will be”. After a very long discussion, lasting until 01:00 am at night, Parliament finally voted to keep the Government by a 57.5% majority. This means that the present Government, which was set up five months ago, will remain unchanged until the next General Election.	http://www.news.mn/r/234399

Mining: Reduction in operating licenses in 2016?	Currently, 3436 special licenses have been provided in Mongolia, of which 1939 are exploration licenses and 1497 are operating licenses for mining companies. We decided to ask the director of the Mineral Resource Authority, D.Uuriintuya, “if the companies which have operating licenses will be able to function as normal in 2016?” In reply, D.Uuriintuya said, “280 companies of the total 1497 license holders have submitted their operation plans for the year. Of this number, only 130 companies have been approved and received permission to operate in 2016”. Therefore, it looks as if the numbers of the mining companies might be reduced this year.	http://www.news.mn/r/234401
How many days for Tsagaan Sar holiday?	Some websites have informed that the Tsagaan Sar holiday will continue for a week. This information is not correct.

Mortgage rates to be reduced	The Government and Bank of Mongolia have announced that the mortgage rate is to be reduced from 8% to 5%. Therefore, those people who have taken mortgages at 8% naturally want to know whether their rates will be reduced following this new decision.

As a result, the 5% mortgage rate will take effect from April 2016. Existing mortgage holders, currently on the 8% rate can change to the 5% in April”. It should be noted that the 30% apartment pre-payment policy will not be changed. Economists consider that the reduction of pre-payment would increase the burden on mortgage holders’ families.	http://www.news.mn/r/234502

“Justice Union Group” – days numbered?	It is being reported that the three MP’s G.Uyanga, L.Tsog, and O.Baasankhuu, who planned to bring down the Saikahnbileg Government, are now about to cause the collapse of the Justice Union Group in Parliament, of which they are members. According to the law, for a group in Parliament to exist - it must have a working quorum of at least 8 members. If these three MP’s leave the Justice Union Group there will not be a quorum and it will have to be disbanded. We, therefore, asked MP G.Uyanga to clarify this. Here is her response: -The Justice Union Group, which combines the Mongolian People’s Revolution Party (MPRP) and the Mongolian National Democratic Party (MNDP), has many mistakes. For example, our party has, on several occasions, made official demands, to Parliament, about Oyu-Tolgoi. But, the Justice Union Group has protected the Government. The Justice Union Group is not able to work fairly. Also, there is the current sensation about Minister G.Shiilegdamba who was arrested and is at present on bail. However, the disintegration of the Justice Union Group is not our intention. Under any circumstances, leaving the group would be the easiest choice - I am not looking for easiest choices. We could choose to leave, if it is absolutely necessary. Being involved in the group is a strong subject. Unfortunately, the group is not working in the right direction.	http://www.news.mn/r/234736

Putin wipes Mongolia’s slate clean	On 27th January, the Russian State Duma approved a bill to cancel the Mongolian national debt. On Monday 1st February, President Vladimir Putin signed the contract to annulling the debt. The agreement onthe contract took place in 2010. From the Mongolian side, S.Bayartsogt who is now Director of the Government Administration, but was then Minister of Finance contributed much to the preparation of this contract. In short,97% of the Mongolian debt of USD 174.2 million has been nullified. We therefore spoke to MrBayartsogt about the Russian agreement. -During the Coalition Government of 2009-2012, I worked on three important agreements; namely,Oyu-Tolgoi, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Russian debt. All of them went successfully. At the time when the Coalition Government was established, Mongolia owed money to two countries, namely Russia and Finland. It can be said that these debts were entirely solved during the time of the Coalition Government. The Russian debt was connected to the “Mongolrostsvetmet” Joint Venture. In 2003, Mongolia owed USD 124.6 million and its rates. “Mongolrostsvetmet”, however, was not able to pay what it owed; this was where the problem began. In 2009, during the meeting of World Bank and IMF, Russian Deputy Minister of Finance D.Pankin said that Russia would take Mongolia to the Paris Club. Therefore, the National Security Council tasked me with making an agreement with Russia. As a result, we had several meetings in Moscow, Ulaanbaatar, and Washington with the working group, headed by the then Russian Finance MinisterAlekseiKudrin and Deputy Finance Minister Pankin. As a result of the long agreements, which lasted about a year, we decided to cancel 97.8% of the total USD 174.2 million. On 14th December 2010, the Russian and Mongolian Ministers of Finance signed a contract to this effect in Moscow. The contract included the payment of the remaining USD 3.8 million within 30 days from the day when the final contract would be approved. This is the story of how the “Mongolrostsvetmet” debt to Russia was solved. Also, in November 2009, Mongolia solved the debt to Finland during an agreement in Helsinki. As a result, Mongolia now does not have any old debt to any country – that is as long as Mongolia pays USD 3.8 million (MNT 7.6 billion) to Russia within 30 days.	http://www.news.mn/r/234835

Mongolia and the World Bank - 25 Years on the Path Toward Prosperity	Open Editorial by Resident Representative of the World Bank in Mongolia Mr. James Anderson In order to know the way forward, it helps to review the past. It was 25 years ago, as the global order changed with the sweeping transitions from plans to markets, that Mongolia joined the World Bank. Within a decade, it was a member of all five institutions that make up the World Bank Group. Mongolia’s decision to join the international financial institutions came as old political blocs and economic alliances were crumbling, and a new epoch of globalization was just beginning. For Mongolia, the loss of Soviet aid and the imminent collapse of old trading arrangements led to economic and human hardship. Joining the World Bank meant expanding the range of partners and integrating with the rest of the world. Mongolia was the World Bank’s 155th member, part of a wave of additions from the former socialist countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Poland and what was then Czechoslovakia had rejoined after withdrawing years before, and the 15 countries from the former Soviet Union, among others, followed Mongolia to help boost World Bank membership to the current total of 188. The headlines of those 25 years are not hard to determine. We can easily find the sum of the financial flows (more than $800 million) and identify the sectors supported, the social and economic issues analyzed and the technical assistance provided. But headlines don’t tell the full story of more than two decades of partnership and collaboration. What have been the impacts and achievements? How has the nature of Mongolia’s relationship with the World Bank evolved over that quarter century? What does the future hold? Such questions demand more than a single article or celebratory event. Indeed, understanding how you got to where you are is as important as where you are. With that concept in mind, we will be embarking on a journey of 25 years in 25 days to fully explore the shared history of Mongolia and the World Bank. Starting next week, we will review the key milestones year by year — from the signing of the Articles of Agreement in February 1991 to the signing of the Voluntary Code of Practice on Water Management in February 2016; from the first loan for Economic Rehabilitation to the latest grant on Mainstreaming Social Accountability; from the 1991 report titled Mongolia—Toward a Market Economy to the November 2015 Mongolia Economic Update. In the earliest days, much of the World Bank’s support was aimed at helping Mongolia cope with the transition, on survival and rehabilitation—keeping the mines and power plants operational and the coal deliveries on schedule—and on building the rudiments of a private sector and new financial and legal systems. As the years went on, attention to poverty and human development deepened, as did support for rural livelihoods. Citizens were given voice on public expenditure allocations at soum level and below. An early project supported Mongolia’s rural infrastructure; a later project helped develop Mongolia’s Internet infrastructure. In trying to better understand how the paths of Mongolia and the World Bank supported, reinforced and depended on each other, I have been writing to colleagues who worked in Mongolia for their reminiscences and reflections. Their stories reveal what the World Bank brought to Mongolia, as well as what Mongolia has brought to the World Bank and beyond: lessons and good practices in public financial management that are the envy of many peers in former socialist countries; the world’s first index-based livestock insurance system; proof that widespread adoption of solar technology at the household (ger) level is not only feasible but helpful, efficient, and sustainable. How will Mongolia’s economy and society develop over the next 25 years? That question raises many more — did anyone foresee in 1991 that Mongolia would be so driven by mining 25 years later? Yet some predictions are a	http://www.news.mn/r/235551

Gandan to become tourist district	Toursim has always been an important part of the Mongolian economy. According to the Bank of Mongolia the average tourist spends USD 190 each day in the country. There is, however, huge room for improvement, not least in the capital Ulaanbaatar. Ulaanbaatar has a MNT 3.6 billion budget for tourism in 2016. The City Administraton has set a target to increase tourist numbers by 10% (40,000 tourists). In 2015 the tourism budget was MNT 3.4 billion; the revenue generated by tourists visiting UB last year was MNT 20 billion. The 2016 action plan has a number of specific actions. These include - modernizing hotels and motels and organizing international conferences during the non-tourism seasons and encouraging the participants to experience what UB has to offer. Last year, 385,000 tourists visited Mongolia. For 92% of them, the destination was the Mongolian countryside; Ulaanbaatar merely being the place they arrived at and left from. To attempt to alter this trend, the City Administration is implementing the “Hospitable Ulaanbaatar” program, with the aim of improving the money cycle from the sector. According to the program plan, the area around the Gandantegchinlen Monastery (Gandan), with its narrow winding streets, will become a dedicated culture and tourism district. Also, the “Khurel Togoot” astronomy center, near the city, with its clear skies and stars is planned to become a key UB tourist attraction.	http://www.news.mn/r/235590

Japanese coal enrichment plant for Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi	Mongolia is rich in mineral resources; however, it has one major disadvantage, namely, a shortage of water where it is most needed. Coal, for example is normally enriched by using large amounts of water. For example: 4-5 million cubic metres of water is required to enrich 30 million tonnes of coal. Tavan Tolgoi, is Mongolia’s most important coal deposit with estimated reserves of 6.4 billion tonnes, of which a quarter is high quality coking coal. Its location? Umnugovi Province in the Gobi desert! On Tuesday 16th February a landmark memorandum of co-operation was concluded between Mongolia and Japan to establish a pilot coal enrichment plant using “dry” treatment at the Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi mine. The signatories, the Mongolian Ministry of Mining and the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry agreed that the technical plans of the plant would be completed during the quarter of 2016, construction would start in the 1st quarter of 2017 and production to take effect from 1st quarter of 2018. The Japanese dry enrichment plant has a planned annual capacity of 300,000 tonnes of coal. The total financing of USD 13 million comes in the form of Japanese grant aid. The Mongolian side will be responsible for plant management.	http://www.news.mn/r/235706
Hyundai “Excel” drivers unite against Person Number Four	At 9:00 in morning of 15th February, some Hyundai “Excel” demonstrated with their vehicles outside of the Constitutional Court (CC). They demanded that the Court be dismissed, because its activity has become too politicized. They also blame the CC, for the decision to stop 8% mortgage loans. But why Hyundai “Excel” cars? The demonstrators explained that before Tsagaan Sar, CC director J.Amarsanaa, had made a disparaging comment about this popular vehicle: “I am the Mongolian Person Number Four; The fourth person can drive an “Excel” rather than a high-quality car”.	http://www.news.mn/r/235785
A man and his marmots	G.Tumenkhuu is a herder in the Sant Soum of the Selenge Province. Because marmots were an endangered species in this district back in the 1980’s, Mr.Tumenkhuu decided to do something about it – he started domesticating marmots from his nativeland Khovd province in the far west of Mongolia. We spoke to him about his relationship with these rodents: -What first inspired you to breed marmots in the Selenge Province? -In 1980, I attended a small conference on animal protection. During the conference, I felt the urge to do something about protecting the environment and animals. Since then, I have been working as a natural conservationist in Selenge Province and for 20 years I have tried to plant at least one tree, and to save one animal each year. There was a time, when Selenge had marmots. But then the hunters drove them nearly to extinction; only 2 marmots remained. So, I have been domesticating marmots from my birth place in Khovd Province. Today, there are 119 marmots in 17 burrows. The biological species is the “Black Altai Marmot”. My goal is not only protecting marmots. I want to protect and breed other animals, which are listed in the Red Book of Threatened Species. -Is marmot breeding useful to nature? -The Marmot is beneficial to grass and plants. Also, it has a cheerful influence on humans. For example, I feel joy when I hear the sound of the marmots, while I am busy with my horses. Of course, breeding threatened animals is a great thing.	http://www.news.mn/r/235786

A tough decision for Custom House and Taxation boss	Two months have passed since Parliament decided to merge the General Custom House with the General Taxation Authority thereby making a state budget saving of MNT 3.6 trillion. At a regular meeting of the Government, former Deputy Minister of Finance S.Purev was appointed as director of the newly intergrated authority. During the first period of joint activity, the Custom House and Taxation Authority has done very well by generating MNT 400 million more revenue than planned. Director Purev now faces a very difficult task – to lay off 147 members of staff, in order to meet the budget cuts; the only alternative would be drastically reducing salaries across the organization.	http://www.news.mn/r/235811
Oooops! Lawmakers forget to include import provision in new law	The revised “Electoral Law”, which is approved by the end of 2015, has not included the provision, which states that “the Electoral Law” cannot be changed, six months prior to an election”. This means that it is now still possible to change this law. All previous versions of the “Electoral Law” included this provision. So we decided to seek clarification on this issue with A.Bakei, who is an MP and also director of the State Structure Standing Committee. Mr Bakei worked as the director of the working team on the draft “Electoral Law” project. The new law does not include the provision that the electoral law cannot be changed six months prior to an election. Was this provision included or not included in the draft as originally presented by the team headed by MP. R.Burmaa? Or was it removed during the process of the working team, headed by you? From the outset, the draft law as presented did not include this provision. The previous laws used to include this provision. The working team, therefore, did not discuss this. Then, the project was approved. So, Parliament did not know that this provision was missing? No-one has remembered to include the provision during the discussion of the project? The Members of the Parliament, actually, did not notice that the provision was missing. Then, when did Parliament find out that an important provision was missing? After the final discussion of the project? Yes So now what is to be done? Is it going to be possible to insert the change to the law? I do not know. If it is considered really necessary, the Members of the Parliament have the right to present law changes. But, I do not know if this will be really that necessary. Finally, is the budget sufficient for the election? This year, MNT 17 billion has been budgeted for the election. I think that it will be enough for the organization of the election.	http://www.news.mn/r/235849
Enkhbayar probe: report not delivered to the Government	The Independent Authority Against Corruption (IAAC) has been preparing a report on the Chairman of the Mongolian People’s Revolutionary Party, N.Enkhbayar. The former President has been proposed to be appointed as Deputy Prime Minister to the Governmental Administration. The IAAC report is due to be delivered to the Government. Our sources have said that the report consideres that the period of Mr Enkhbayar’s court sentence has not yet expired. It will be recalled that in April 2012, he was arrested by the IAAC for his involvement in the illegal privatization of state owned property; in August of the same year, he was sentenced to 7 years. While in prison his health suffered and he was pardoned by President Elbegdorj. Although the 7 years was reduced to 4 years, this period has not expired. Therefore, we clarified about whether the report had been received from the Senior Director of the Governmental Administration Sh.Solongo and legal advisor N.Munkh-Erdene, they provided same answer that: “Currently, the IAAC report has not been delivered to the Government”.	http://www.news.mn/r/235850

Non-regular meeting of Parliament finally goes ahead	Even though, the non-regular meeting of Parliament was scheduled for 14.00 pm yesterday, the meeting had to be postponed again. This was because only 37 MP’s turned up, in other words, less than 50% of the required turnout. Those who came were: 34 members of the Democratic Party Group, 2 members of the Mongolian National Democratic Party and 1 member of the Civil Will Green Party. As before, no members of the Mongolian People’s Party or the Mongolian People’s Revolutionary Party came to the meeting. In order to convene a non-regular meeting, at least 39 MPs must attend. Therefore, Parliamentary Speaker Z.Enkhbold announced to re-call the non-regular meeting today at 09.00 pm. But by 11.00 am, the meeting had still not opened, for same reason. This frustrating situation changed when two members of the Justice Union Group, namely Z.Baynselenge and D.Terbishdagva arrived. This meant that the 39 member quorum (50%) had been met and the meeting could commence. The meeting has gone ahead without the MPP, who are boycotting it.	http://www.news.mn/r/235952

During the meetings in Beijing, the two sides discussed improving the usage of these six air gates and to study the opening of the new 7th Mongolian-Chinese air gate. In addition, on 17th February, the memorandum was signed to procure a “Harbin” Y-12 twin-engine turboprop from the AVIC International Aero Development Corporation, in order to conduct trial flights in Mongolia.

The income received from advertising is not enough to finance either contents or TV employees. In the future, the Copyright Law and the Intellectual Property Law should be updated. If infringement of these laws continues, high-quality TV and media cannot be improved. Respect of copyright will lead to a reduction in the number of poor quality networks”.

P.Amar, the general secretary of the Federation, provided the following explanation: “The IAAC is engaged in organizing political repression. For example two victims are MPRP Chairman N.Enkhbayar or P.Tsogtbaatar who is General Secretary in charge of MPRP finances. This is not 1937! The repressions, aimed at one party or one person go to prove that the IAAC is acting under polical influences.

O.Baasankhuu: I do not want to be the one, who refuses to go when I am banished	Mr O.Baasankhuu is an MP who has challenged the Prime Minister to appear on a panel show. He has been answering questions: -Why did you call the Prime Minister to the panel show? -Since becoming an MP, I have proposed 32 bills, practically all of which have been rejected Government. Proposing a bill is not that easy – it’s not just sitiing at the computer. I prepared these draft laws, co-operating with the non-governmental organizations based on the research. But the Government has not accepted my proposals. Therefore, I want to prove that my bills should be accepted by the Government, and therefore demand that the Prime Minister justify the position of his Government. -For example, which of your law projects have not been accepted? -There are a lot. The last one was a bill aimed at supporting the Erdenet plant - another was the bill on the “heritage of cities and villages”. These were not accepted. In my opinion, these both would have been beneficial to Mongolia -What explanation did the Government provide for not accepting these bills? -They just said “no”. The Director of the Government Administration, S.Bayartsogt said that: “These are just the responses from the Ministries. I did not decide this on my own. I let your projects be discussed at the Governmental meeting - although briefly – in the time permitting”. I am grateful to him. He has worked well. -Have you said that if you lose the panel show, you will not stand as a candidate in the next election? - I did not say that. But I have said that I will reject my seat as an MP. I think that sitting in Parliament is useless. -Can you really reject your seat, if you lose the debate? -Can I? It is no big deal to become politically “dead”, if I reject my seat. I am a trained lawyer and have worked in this profession. I was not born a politician. -So, will you leave the politics, if you lose? -People with political ability must engage in politics. There are many people, who entered the politics without being invited – and, who refuse to go when they are banished. I don’t want to be like them. -Recently, there have been rumors that you might become Minister of Health and Sport? -I have given my answer. When the Mongolian People’s Party (MPP) was dismissed from the Government – I no longer wanted to be part of that Government. I am a young man. I have my self respect. I do not want to play such trivial games. -If the MPP were to propose you as a minister, would you still reject the proposal? -Yes, I would. It is not because I do not want to be a minister; it is because I think that I cannot possibly enter a Government headed by Ch.Saikhanbileg. NevetheIess, I am still grateful to the MPP, for having such a high opinion of me, but I repeat, I cannot possibly serve on that Cabinet.	http://www.news.mn/r/236725

Strategic merger: MNDP and Ekh Oron Party?	On 11th March, the Chairman of the Mongolian National Democratic Party (MNDP), M.Enkhsaikhan, met with his opposite number in the Ekh Oron Party - B.Erdenebat. During the meeting, the two chairmen discussed the current situation of the economy and the run up to the election. They also exchanged their opinions about a merger which would result in the creation of the “Ekh Oron Democracy Justice” union. In 2012, the MNDP created the “Justice Union” with the Mongolian People’s Revolutionary Party, and took 11 parliamentary seats; they could not, however, acheve success in parliamentary operations. In addition, several months ago, the Democratic Party invited the MNDP to co-operate in a similar manner in the forthcoming election. The Chairman of the MNDP has still not responded to this invitation. Taking into consideration last Friday’s meeting, it seems likely that the MNDP will merge with the Ekh Oron Party.	http://www.news.mn/r/237868

Pyongyang’s alleged Mongolian smuggling route: the MFA response	Last week, “United Press International” (UPI), quoting Radio Free Asia, ran a story entitled “North Korean diplomats smuggling luxury goods through Mongolia – the route is being used to send banned goods to Pyongyang”. This story was picked up by Mongolian news agencies. The RFA source is quoted as saying that “Pyongyang&#39s diplomats are using their passports to carry the goods across the border undetected. Electronic components that can be used in nuclear and missile production are being transported across the route.” The latest UN Security Council sanctions resolution is aimed at the non-weapons trade, in particular expensive goods; it is well known that Kim Jong-un has a particular penchant for elite luxury items. UPI specifically mentions luxury watches, jet skis and snowmobiles all valued at more than $2000 as being targeted. According to the UPI article: “The goods are sometimes listed under a third-party firm or individual to cross into Mongolia from China, and the illegal goods movement is concealed by legitimate businesses”. The Mongolian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stated that the information about illicit activity among N.Korea’s diplomats in Ulaanbaatar is unfounded. In the same statement, the Mongolian MFA said that the reports about a secret visit to Ulaanbaatar by the N.Korean Foreign Minister were incorrect.	http://www.news.mn/r/238044

Therefore, the Supreme Court rejected both Naidalaa’s and Ganbaatar’s claims for the post. As a result, former NLP Chairman S.Borgil remains in his seat.	http://www.news.mn/r/238465

Mongolians working abroad on the rise	Currently, 125,000 Mongolians are living and working abroad, of whom 25,000 are in South Korea. Each year several thousand people travel to that country, in order to work - mostly in the industrial sector. A sociological study of the broader family problems shows the psychological difficulties often faced by their children, who are left in Mongolia with grandparents. The study also shows that many couples who have been separated over the course of several years, as a result of one of the pair working abroad, end up getting divorced. As the number of Mongolians going abroad to work seems to be on the incease, the family issues raised in the study are likely to become more serious.	http://www.news.mn/r/238553

G.Uyanga: we just had to leave…	Yesterday, two Members of Parliament, G.Uyanga and L.Tsog informed that they are leaving their “Justice Union” group. We, therefore, spoke to G.Uyanga about her decision. -Yesterday, you and MP L.Tsog informed that you have decided to leave “Justice Union” group. Why did you choose to take this step? -I have been criticizing the “Justice Union” group recently. The “Justice Union” group took a poll from the people, and announced the program “Five Revolutions to Save Mongolia”. The group has worked so poorly for the implementation of this program. Maybe, they have paid more attention as to ministerial appointments than to this program. L.Tsog and I have been loyal to “Five Revolutions to Save Mongolia” until now. -Should the “Justice Union” approve your decision to leave the group? -The law does not include any specific provisions for this. Anyway, an MP has the full right to choose his or her group. The director of the group must present our intention to the Parliamentary Speaker; then the Speaker must announce our intentions Parliament. -Leaving the “Justice Union” group can be understood that you are leaving the party? -We will stay in the party for now. It is not clear what actions will be taken in the future. -MP O.Baasankhuu, L.Tsog and you were in agreement on the issue of dismissing the Prime Minister. Does O.Baasankhuu share the same position with you regarding leaving the group? -I do not know his position on this issue -How will the “Justice Union” group work in the future, without you and L.Tsog? -The group still has 8 members – that is enough to work on parliamentary matters.	http://www.news.mn/r/238668
Nicolas Cage and the Mongolian dinosaur	In December 2015, the US Customs and Border Protection Agency made a decision to return the skull of a Tarbosaurus Bataar (commonly called a “Tyrannosaurus” Bataar), which had been illegally smuggled from Mongolia to the USA in 2007, and sold at auction. Initially it was not known who the current owner of the 67 million years-old skull was. An investigation revealed that Hollywood star Nicholas Cage bought the skull for USD 276.000 at an auction in Beverley Hills. Nicholas Cage, aged 52, said he did not know anything about the illegal activities connected with the skull and stressed that he was innocent. The actor has not been accused of any crime and accepted the decision for the precious object to be handed over to the Mongolian Government. On 11th March, New-York County District Attorney made the final decision to give back the skull to Mongolia, in accordance with which Nicolas Cage will hand it over before 4th April 2016. The Tarbosaurus Bataar, was a 6 ton carnivore, which lived in what is now the Gobi Desert. Slightly smaller than its American relative cousin the Tyrannosaurus Rex, both lived in the Late Cretaceous at the end of the age of the dinosaurs. It will be recalled, that as a result of the personal intervention of President Ts.Elbegdorj, a complete Tarbosaurus skeleton, which was illegally being sold at auction in the United States was returned home.	http://www.news.mn/r/238675

35 years of Mongolian meat soup in zero gravity	March 22nd marks the 35th anniversary of the day when a Mongolian was blasted into space. On this day, Hero of Mongolia, Major General J.Gurragchaa became the 101st person in space and Mongolia became the 10th country which had sent one of its citizens into earth orbit. He was also the second Asian in space. J.Gurragchaa was born on 5th December 1947, in the Gurvanbulag soum of Bulgan Province. Cosmonaut Gurragchaa’s Soyuz-39 spacecraft completed 124 orbits over a period of one week 20 hours 42 minutes. Mongolia and the USSR spent five years in selecting and preparing Gurragchaa. In 1977, he was selected from 10,000 people during a process involving rigorous medical tests In second phase, 13 people were examined went through a further 17 tests resulting in four people, including J.Gurragchaa being shortlisted. The others were M.Ganzorig, D.Surenkhorloo and S.Saintsog. J.Gurragchaa took soil samples from Altanbulag, the River Khalkh and Erdenet with his into space. Local factories produced 60 kinds of new products “branding” the first Mongolian in space, including, candy, matches, drinks, hat, shirt and also “Bolor” vodka. J.Gurragchaa took 30 special items with him into orbit. These included the Mongolian flag, the constitution, and “symbols” of state, namely the Suld and Soyombo, a traditional jade snuff bottle from his father, 10 tugriks from his mother and, finally, a photograph of Marshal Tsedenbal. On 22th March 1981, a total of 206 babies were born in Mongolia, many of whom were given names such as cosmos (sansar) and star (od); 15 of them were named Gurragchaa. Several children were also named Janebekov – the cosmonaut’s patronymic. The legacy of J.Gurragchaa’s space flight continues today: even today Russian’s take Mongolian dried meat and Mongolian sea buckthorn into orbit with them. During the Intercosmos program, these foods were tested during J.Gurragchaa’s week in space. Therefore, traditional Mongolian dried meat and sea buckthorn have remained on the safety food list The Soyuz landing module, which brought J.Gurragchaa safely back to earth, can be seen at the Astronomy & Space Flight Museum in Ulaanbaatar. In addition to a display of space suits, equipment and model space craft – there is also a state-of-the art planetarium and a lecture theatre making this one of the finest establishments of its kind in Asia.	http://www.news.mn/r/238688

Forced entry in Government House: Deputy PM tell us what happened	On Tuesday 22nd March, at 13.15 pm, four representatives of the Independent Authority Against Corruption (IAAC) entered the office of Deputy Prime Minister Ts.Oyunbaatar, while he was having a meeting. N.Enkhbayar, who is chairman of the Mongolian National People’s Revolutionary Party was present at the meeting. The four IAAC officers handed over an official document to Mr Enkhbayar. The IAAC stated: “We have called suspect N.Enkhbayar to provide a statement on five occasions. So far, he did not come to the IAAC for investigation. Therefore, we handed the official document to him, when he was in office of the Deputy Prime Minister”. News.mn decided to ask Deputy Prime Minister Ts.Oyunbaatar exactly what happened. -Yesterday (22nd March), several IAAC agents came to your office. Why did they come? Four people from the IAAC forcibly entered my office at around 13.15 pm, without presenting any identification. At the time our party chairman and people related to the election were having a meeting. They explained that they had come to hand over an official document. The action of the IAAC agents is, firstly, a violation of Mongolian law, in particular the “Law on Government House”, “Law on Members of Parliament” and the “Law on Members of the Government”. I have, therefore, sent a letter, demanding an official explanation to the director of IAAC N.Ganbold. Secondly, people who have temporary and permanent passes can enter the Government House. But, yesterday people who do not have permission entered the office of the Mongolian Deputy Prime Minister. This demonstrates that the legitimacy, safety and human rights of the state service are being violated. As Deputy Prime Minister and as a human rights lawyer I openly state that this is as very serious action. -What was the nature of the official demand, which was given to N.Enkhbayar? -There is no need to talk about this - because the document was not addressed to me.	http://www.news.mn/r/238852

Young Mongolian footballers training in London	In an article entitled – “From chopping wood in -25 degrees to playing in the shadow of the Wembley arch…”, Jonny Singer, a journalist with the UK’s “Daily Mail”, has written extensively about the experiences of two young Mongolian footballers, currently training with Barnet Football Club’s Youth Academy, namely 16 year-old G.Ganbayar of the Khoromkhon Club and 20 year-old S.Gal-Erdene who plays for the Erchim Club. In recent years, Mongolia has been doing much to develop the abilities of its young players. Jonny Singer, notes, that so far Mongolia has not produced a world class professional – but, this is just a matter of time. Much of the article deals with the very different and difficult conditions young Mongolian footballers face compared to their UK peers. Singer writes: ‘These kids can become as good as anybody, really fast, if given the opportunity. And seeing Ganbaa do so well, it’s a confirmation that we are doing the right things, we’re not so far off.’ Ganbaa, who grew up an Arsenal fan from 4,000 miles away, knows his target – and it’s a simple one: ‘I’ve always thought I was going to become a professional, even when I was really young. ‘The ultimate goal is to be part of a professional club, get a contract that would be huge. But for now, I&#39ve just got to keep trying.’ There are murmurs around the club that Ganbaa, who has made the bigger impression of the two boys, would be good enough to earn a contract next year. Certainly, in footballing terms, he would be worth one, even though logistically it may be a step too far for now. The talent is there.” The two boys are training at the Barnet Football Club’s Youth Academy, which specializes on training future stars, under a deal negotiated with the Mongolian Football Administration. Barnet is a borough of West London; Wembley Stadium is located nearby.	http://www.news.mn/r/239183

“MPP supports nuclear waste entering Mongolia”	The director of Democratic Party Group B.Garamgaibaatar has given the following information to the media: -Today is the second day of the non-regular parliamentary session. Today, the Speaker’s council held a meeting. We had scheduled to discuss the law projects presented by the Government during the parliamentary discussion; however, no-one from the Mongolian People’s Party (MPP) came to the hall. The Democratic Party is trying to work. Everybody is obliged to work, when the Speaker issues an order for a session to be convened. The MPP is not supporting a law project, which is aimed to be beneficial to Mongolia. The law project presented by the government yesterday has three provisions, all of which ban nuclear and radioactive materials from entering Mongolia. We still have an opportunity to discuss and approve this bill. But the MPP is apparently supporting nuclear waste entering Mongolia. If these three provisions are approved, Mongolia will not have to worry about anything. The non-regular session is planned to start today at 14.00 pm.	http://www.news.mn/r/239493
Nuclear debate: another delay	Yesterday, the Democratic Party Group held a non-scheduled meeting as a result of the delay in the start of the non-regular session of Parliament. The group decision was: “Government should present the new law projects about nuclear safety to Parliament”. In other words, the Government decided not to postpone the law projects including the “Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and the Safety of Radioactive Management”. As we reported, there had been discussion about submitting these to Parliament at a later date. So the Government has submitted them. Therefore, Parliament now needs to discuss and approve these projects which the Government presented yesterday. According to DP Group director, B.Garamgaibaatar, the new law project contains provisions banning the entry of nuclear waste into Mongolia or the import of such materials. According to the decision, yesterday, R.Jigjid the Minister of Mining presented the law project to the Parliamentary Speaker. This morning, again the non-regular session could not start due to inadequate attendance by the Opposition. Therefore, the non-regular session has been recalled at 14.00 pm.	http://www.news.mn/r/239494

Mongolia welcomes 2.7 million newborn animals	At the beginning of the 2016, it was estimated that Mongolia had a breeding stock of 23.8 million female animals, of which, 105,200 were female camels, 952,500 mares, 1,400,000 cows, 10,600,000 ewes and 9,600,000 female goats.

USD 500 million governmental bonds issued	The Mongolian Government has issued USD 500 million worth of bonds to the international market. In January 2016, the GoM was planning to issue “Mazaalai” bond for the value of USD 800 million. The rates, however increased, as a result of the political actions of MP G.Uyanga and the Mongolian People’s Party in their attempt to oust Prime Minister Ch.Saikhanbileg. The Government, therefore, decided to postpone the issuing of the bonds for an indefinite period until USD 500 could be raised from international markets. The bond has been underwritten by three international bodies, namely, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and two Mongolian organizations, namely, the Trade and Development Bank and Golomt Bank. The purchasers, who were all owners of the previous governmental bonds, have requested to buy bonds totaling USD 780 million.	http://www.news.mn/r/239635
Radioactive materials debate: MPP boycott Parliament	The non-regular session of Parliament, which was called by Speaker Z.Enkhbold last week, has still not commenced; as usual the reason is that the Mongolian People’s Party (MPP) did not show up. The only MP’s in the house were from the Democratic Party and the Justice Union. Today’s session had been scheduled for 09:00 am. As there was no quorum, it was postponed until 02:00 pm – unfortunately, the situation did not change. Most of the business, which the Speaker has listed for discussion, involves Mongolian involvement in international conventions on radioactive materials. Yesterday (30th March), Speaker Enkhbold added a sixth draft law to the five already slated for debate, namely a bill to “Ban spent Fuel, Nuclear and Radioactive Materials from entering the Mongolian Border”. Regarding the specific administrative details; the original order calling the non-regular session was Directive 40 of the 25th March; Speaker Enkhbold amended this on 30th March by issuing Directive 46 which provides for the inclusion of the additional debate.

Foreigners without visas	It is estimated that between 25,000 and 30,000 foreigners are currently living in Mongolia on a permanent basis. The main reasons for domicile are labor, study and receiving medical treatment. Many of them face problems because their visas have expired; sometimes, it would appear that this is deliberate on the part of the foreign nationals. At present, Mongolia does not have an immigration removal center where the foreigners without visas can be held in humane conditions pending the necessary steps being taken for them to leave the country. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has noted that the only facility available is one room at the Mongolian Immigration Authority where they are examined; there is nowhere for them to stay and they are not put into custody – although technically they are in violation of the law. Although they are responsible for the fact that their visas have expired, they should neither be classed as criminals nor left in limbo. Therefore, the NHRC considers that the custody house is necessary to have. There are cases, that Mongolians abroad whose visas are expired are placed in an immigration removal center in that particular country. The NHRC raised the matter of the lack of an immigration removal center during a press conference held on 31st March.	http://www.news.mn/r/239842

Land of sun and wind: 7th Renewable Energy Forum opens in UB	Today, Parliamentary Speaker Z.Enkhbold participated in the opening of the 7th annual Renewable Energy Forum, which is organized by the Ministry of Energy and the Mongolian Wind Energy Association. In his speech the Speaker said: “Mongolia has huge energy reserves. Experts have proven that Mongolia has the ability to develop alternative energy sources of up to 2.6 terawatts, using the energy of the sun, wind, water and geothermal heat. For example: in 2001, the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Mongolian experts jointly developed an Atlas of Mongolian Wind Reserves. This atlas confirms that 10% of Mongolian territory has fabulous wind reserve potential. By using these wind reserves, Mongolia could generate 2.5 million gigawatts of electricity. Regarding solar energy, Mongolia has the Gobi, where 270 days are sunny days with clear skies – just slightly less than the Sahara. Therefore, Mongolia has a big future with renewable energy. Currently, renewable energy accounts for only 8% of total energy produced in Mongolia. Over the next 5 years, we are going to increase the production of renewable energy by implementing ten projects to the value of USD 1.5 billion in the solar and wind energy sectors”. The 7th Renewable Energy Forum is being attended by approximately, 300 representatives, including foreign and Mongolian energy experts and NGOs.	http://www.news.mn/r/240143

Renewable energy: wind farms and solar power plant	Yesterday, the 7th National Renewable Energy Forum opened in Ulaanbaatar’s “Corporate Hotel”. This is the main energy sector forum and has been taking place since 2008. Regarding the directions of future energy policy, in June 2015, Mongolia approved a document entitled “General Measures to Develop Renewable Energy Until 2030”. In 14th September 2015, eleven MP’s headed by S.Oyun presented a bill entitled “VAT and Custom Tax exemptions for renewable energy equipment”. Parliament approved this and it became law on 18th December 2015. Ten companies have obtained special permission to construct energy solar and wind power facilities which will generate 600 megawatt. This includes one or two wind farms and a 10 megawatt solar energy plant – construction is likely to start later this year. It would, therefore, appear that everything is on target to meet the 20% renewable energy target by 2023 and 30% by 2030.	http://www.news.mn/r/240269

The exhibition features artwork that combines modern and traditional elements. “The negative impacts of globalization, urbanization, and the rapid development of technology are separating humans from nature and the earth.

Diseases have increased as we have drawn from nature, and the intervention of technology in daily connections and conversations are one of the sources of negative incidents in society. I think you can see the benefits of organic products and how they are works of art,” the artist said. Approximately 10 mixed media works incorporating animal bones, wood, rocks, and garments are presented in the exhibition.

The exhibition consists of mixed media work and installations by contemporary artists D.Batzorig, E.Jantsankhorol, A.Ochirbold, T.Enkhbold, O.Enkhtaivan, and D.Bayartsetseg. The viewer is welcomed by “Drip” by D.Batzorig, an installation with water in constant movement underneath a wood sculpture. D.Batzorig likes using natural materials to depict the fragile relationship between humans and nature. His installation creates its own sanctuary-like atmosphere. “Drip” consists of unevenly cut pieces of thick branches, and speaks about deforestation, playing with perceptions of space and environmental causes. Beside “Drip” are two mixed media artworks by E.Jantsankhorol. E.Jantsankhorol works with man-made, artificial materials and raises awareness about the pain and negative impact of urbanization through the worms in her work “Comfort Zone-Tooth”, which are sculpted out of construction foam. A.Ochirbold and D.Bayartsetseg offered gallery visitors performance art during the opening of the exhibition. A.Ochirbold placed magnets around the gallery and threw metal at them, representing chaos and randomness. The performance seemed to perfectly describe the relationship between humans and nature, as we are primarily ruled by the laws of nature, but we make cognitive and creative decisions much more differently than other creatures. D.Bayartsetseg, with her perfectly Mongolian features and lamb’s fur deel and Mongolian boots, showed her audience Mongolian traditions and culture in a silent 15 minute performance. D.Bayartsetseg, a teacher, seemed to transfer the culture of uniquely Mongolian items and traditions to a younger generation through her performance. “Contemporary Art of Mongolia IV”, an indicator of contemporary art development in Mongolia, did not disappoint. Visit the exhibition to see how natural materials, such as animal skin, bones, and wood, coexist with man-made materials, such as construction foam, metal coils, and lollipops, to depict the relationship between nature and humanity.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19146
‘Spring’	By M.OYUNGEREL The group exhibition “Spring” is on view at Union of Mongolian Artists Art Gallery through April 11. The exhibition includes over 50 paintings, sculptures, and installations in surrealist, realist, and abstract styles. B.Orkhontuul’s “Portrait of a Mother I Met on the Road” is a puzzle about sexuality, with pieces revealing a naked human form holding a family portrait. The image of a goddess and a fine red line are laid over a woman’s form with surreal depth. The father’s face in the family portrait is from the missing puzzle and a penis peeks from underneath the portrait. Orange slices on a golden lotus pedestal seem to represent an idealized past, when oranges were very rare and considered a luxury item and linked inseparably to the idea of celebration for children of the ‘80s and ‘90s. Pigeons are gathered at the head of the human form, looking as if they were pecking at breadcrumbs, and may represent the public’s disapproval of changes to gender roles during the 1990s. Ch.Baasanjav’s “Riddles”, a Mongol zurag painting, speaks to the artist’s ideas about the current political state of Mongolia. The painting is filled with evil-faced Parliamentarians signing contracts, leading to fire and the deaths of citizens and other Parliamentarians.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19182
‘New Touch’	By M.OYUNGEREL Artist D.Ganbold’s solo exhibition “New Touch” is on view through April 22 at Valiant Art Gallery, on the second floor of Buddha Vista. Approximately 40 oil paintings are presented in the artist’s sixth solo exhibition. The artist paints in the Fauvism style, creating animal and human portraits. Mongol News spoke to D.Ganbold about his new exhibition during its opening on April 8. Most of your artworks depict Mongolian culture. There are some works portraying feminine beauty. What do you usually paint? The paintings presented are artworks I have worked on since 2008. I try not to be limited to a single subject. Of course, as a Mongolian, many of my paintings show Mongolian life. Many of today’s guests are foreigners. How interested are they in paintings concerning Mongolian culture? They’re very interested. Although I paint many different topics, foreigners tend to prefer the ones about Mongolian culture. It’s no wonder that things portraying the unique sides of the country they’re visiting attracts their attention. Generally, foreigners are interested in work by Mongolian artists. Are you cooperating with Valiant Art for this exhibition? Yes. I’m happy they are supporting me in lots of things, including promotion and sales. Usually, Mongolian artists create a lot of amazing work but can’t show a lot of people. They provide this opportunity.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19256
‘From Time to Time’	By M.OYUNGEREL B.Saikhanbayar’s 20th solo endeavor, “From Time to Time”, is on view at Blue Moon Art Gallery through April 20. Approximately 50 contemporary, modern, and abstract paintings are presented in the hall. The artist uses primary colors in his oil paintings to depict happiness in life. “Some might associate the blue in my paintings with being morose, but the blue that was used by Picasso and in other people’s paintings was darker. I use sky blue, as Mongolia is the Land of the Blue Sky, and the color suggests truth and stability,” said B.Saikhanbayar The hall is filled with portraits and landscapes in trios that hint at futurism and cubism. The artist said he took inspiration from nature. “I make travel notes and I usually draw inspiration from the notes when I read them later,” he said. B.Saikhanbayar graduated from the Green Horse School at the School of Fine Arts at the Mongolian University of Arts and Culture in 1995. He is a member artist of the Green Horse Society. According to the artist, the exhibition has a special connection to the number 20. “This marks the 20th year since I graduated university, and this also happens to be my 20th exhibition,” said B.Saikhanbayar.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19285
‘Writing Culture 2016’	By M.OYUNGEREL “Writing Culture 2016”, which was on view at Union of Mongolian Artists Art Gallery through April 20, put a spotlight on traditional Mongolian script, a vessel for preserving and sharing Mongolian history and culture. Linguists believe that traditional Mongolian script, which was made the official state script by Chinggis Khaan himself, is seen as a reflection of the free thinking of Mongolian people. The hall was filled with scripture and creative expressions, epitomizing the artistic value of traditional Mongolian script. Mongolians take pride in their pictographic alphabet that allows a calligrapher to write “horse” and make it look so artfully like a horse. The Union of Mongolian Artists annually organizes the “Writing Culture” exhibition to mark Traditional Writing Day. In the eight years of its organization, “Writing Culture” has come to include Mongolian calligraphy by artists from different countries. For this year’s “Writing Culture” exhibition, the Mongolian Association of Calligraphers cooperated with the Society of Mongolian Calligraphers of Inner Mongolia (China), Ochir Zam Magazine and Tengeriin Bichig Union of Buryatia (Russia), and Zayasan Bichig Union of Kalmykia (Russia). “Writing Culture” traveled for exhibitions in Dundgovi, Arkhangai, Khentii, Darkhan, Selenge, Orkhon-Uul, and Sukhbaatar provinces before being presented in Ulaanbaatar. L.Tuvshinjargal’s “Heart” was chosen as the year’s best artwork. During the exhibition’s opening reception in Ulaanbaatar, the Brush Knowledge calligraphy competition was organized with Mongolian Academy of Sciences linguistics teacher R.Otgonbaatar and artists Ts.Tamir and O.Nyamochir judging the work created. E.Odbayar won first place, M.Buyankhishig won second place, and B.Munkhjargal won third place in the calligraphy competition. “Writing Culture” artists say they plan to participate in international art competitions and exhibitions with Mongolian calligraphy. Their artwork showed the beauty of traditional Mongolian script. The participation of foreign artists of Mongolian origin displayed an admirable level of appreciation for an aspect of Mongolian culture that some Mongolian nationals seem to neglect.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19379
The future of Mongolian fine arts	By Lucy Thompson A joint exhibition by the graduates of the Mongolian School of Fine Arts is running at Q Gallery until April 29. This collection explores the students’ inner worlds and their connection with the changing world around them. The School of Fine Arts, which is 60 years old, holds a portfolio exhibition every year, and this summer’s graduates worked on developing the creativity of their paintings compared to previous years. Each of the 14 artists produced three paintings, expressing one idea in three different forms: realist, abstract, and modern. Through their work, the students aim to discuss the future of Mongolian contemporary fine arts. In addition to their exploration of artistic styles, they also consider their own futures and the future of the country. For example, “The Wait’ by M.Davaasuren depicts a young woman standing at a window. Behind her is a scene of traditional family life, with many children and a mother cradling a baby, yet the woman is turned away from this world to the world beyond. Similarly, B.Enktuvshin’s paintings show the changes in ger camps over time. The scene moves from the bright sun and lush grass of “A Day with Rain” to dark clouds and a grey sky pierced only by a passing plane. The lack of color in “In the Night Sky” emphasises the stark contrast between the airplane and the ger camp. Like “The Wait”, this painting reflects on the divide between the future of a modernized Mongolia and its old, traditional lifestyle and values. Other paintings, such as “Inner World” and “The World of I” focus more on the artist. S.Enkhjikh considers the influence of history on the individual, showing solitary ghostlike figures in a futuristic building, or gazing at a vivid galactic landscape with landmarks from the past. The bold, defined pictures and intense colors in these paintings convey the strength of emotion and the engagement of the students with their subject. This exhibition runs from April 20 through April 29 at Q Gallery, west of Bella Vista.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19421
Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso exhibition coming to Ulaanbaatar	By B.DULGUUN The Ulaanbaatar City Council is organizing the first-ever exhibition of original artwork by Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso in Ulaanbaatar, as part of the Friendly Ulaanbaatar Program, with cooperation from the Fine Arts Zanabazar Museum. Art collector and Russian entrepreneur Alexander Shadrin approached the city council with a proposal to display his collection of artwork by Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso at the Fine Arts Zanabazar Museum. The exhibition will be on view from April 29 to May 29, and will feature sculptures, paintings, drawings, and ceramics by the two prominent artists, created during the peak of their careers. Authorities believe that the exhibition will draw in many visitors eager to view the original work of these two world famous artists. The Fine Arts Zanabazar Museum proposed that the Ulaanbaatar City Council offer its support by providing the 5.7 million MNT required for renting glass display cases to house the sculptures and ceramics, and in publishing a catalog for the exhibition. After a meeting of museum and city officials, the city council agreed to support the exhibition as it supports the goals of the Friendly Ulaanbaatar Program and will enrich the city’s artistic resources, as well as give tourists and local residents the opportunity to view pieces by world renowned artists. “Seeing remarkable, world famous artwork with your own eyes feels incredible. I believe it will be a very nice gift to people who enjoy classic artwork and paintings,” said E.Bat-Uul, Mayor of Ulaanbaatar. The owner of the collection has negotiated earnings from entrance fees for the exhibition, but says he will donate a portion of the income to the Fine Arts Zanabazar Museum.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19432
Facebook blackout stuns the world	By James Watkins Yesterday, access to the world’s most popular social networking site, Facebook, was suspended globally. At the time of going to press, the reason for this blackout had not been announced. When trying to access the Facebook webpage, users across the world were greeted with the message “Sorry, something went wrong. We’re working on getting this fixed as soon as we can.” The blackout started at roughly 4 p.m. (Ulaanbaatar Time) on June 19 and lasted roughly 25 minutes.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=10079
International Youth Day stresses mental health	International Youth Day was observed on August 2, with the underlining theme of “Youth and Mental Health”. “Mongolia has a very young population. Nearly 50 percent of the population is under the age of 25. Then it becomes critical that young people’s issues are freely addressed in government programs, programs that NGOs have, private sector programs and so forth. Mental health is one of those issues that has not yet received good attention, in those respected programs,” Naomi Kitahara, representative for the UN Population Fund, told the UB Post. International Youth Day was endorsed by the U.N. General Assembly in December 1999, through a recommendation made by the World Conference of Ministers Responsible for Youth in August 1998. This year’s International Youth Day seeks to raise awareness of negative labels, stigma and discrimination that are often experienced as a result of mental health conditions. Naomi Kitahara noted that the U.N. will continue to provide support to the Government of Mongolia to address issues faced by young people in Mongolia, and to include a full package of services for youth in government programs, including mental health, reproductive health and gender related issues.

Minister Ts.Oyungerel: Bat’s defamation charge is a threat to democracy and free expression	Minister of Culture Ts.Oyungerel has issued a scathing assessment of the recent libel case which saw her brother, Ts. Bat, imprisoned for some three months for criticizing Transport Minister A.Gansukh on Twitter. In an exclusive interview with the UB Post, the Culture Minister blasted Minister Gansukh for what she sees as a significant threat to Mongolian democratic values. ”[This case] gives a very bad message about Mongolia … We have democracy, we have human rights, that all countries are struggling for. But if we lose it from within, what will we turn into? It is very bad news for Mongolian citizens, for Mongolia’s future, for Mongolian democracy.” The minister highlighted a significant deficit in legal protection for those who come forward. “I think that this [case] shows that Mongolia doesn’t have any protection for whistleblowers,” she said. “It’s because of the deficits in the protections of our citizens, this is our misjudgment… My brother is a professional engineer who had a twenty-year long career in Mongolian aviation. That’s why he knows what’s happening in Mongolian aviation, and if he doesn’t like something, he will express it.” Minister Oyungerel believes the case was politically motivated. “If I list all the punishments that (Bat) received over the course of the past two years, we can say that it was political,” she says. “Imprisonment is just a culmination of what is happening between the whistleblower and the Minister.” Both the Culture and Transport ministers have come into conflict in the past as a result of her longstanding opposition to the privatization of MIAT, a policy then led by the Transport Minister. “When the Minister of Transport rallied strongly to privatize MIAT a few years ago, I was his main opposition in the Parliament,” said Minister Oyungerel. The minister expressed dismay that her brother received a harsher-than-expected sentence. “I was so shocked to hear that it was imprisonment,” she said. “I didn’t attend the court hearing, but I did attend the reading of the court verdict. So when the judge read the verdict, she said that the State Prosecutor wanted to issue a fine… But the judge said, ‘but because Bat is unemployed, I order imprisonment.’ The lower your social status, the harsher the punishment – that was the logic in that verdict.” The minister described the case as “unequal”, with Minister Gansukh using his government position as a means of leverage. “I’m also shocked that the minister filed his complaint on his ministry’s letterhead – with the stamp of the Ministry – so that gives him an unequal power against a citizen,” Oyungerel said, “a citizen who doesn’t have a job, or doesn’t have other status, and doesn’t have government protection. So I think there’s an unequal fight going on, with power being used against citizens’ freedom, and I, of course, stand with citizens’ rights.” Ts.Bat had been on medical leave when he was fired for speaking out against Gansukh, and his health is frail, according to his sister. “[Bat] is worried about his health, as he has a very strict dietary regime. That regime is now gone because of the prison regime… His condition will quickly deteriorate… His attorney asked if he could be placed in the prison hospital. Today (on Wednesday) I heard that he was moved there.” Support has emerged online for Bat’s release, with small protests from the local Twitter community taking place in Chinggis Khan Square earlier in the week, and the hashtag “#FreeBat” receiving increased mentions online. “Since when is social network deemed as press media. Which law mentions this? #FreeBat,” said Twitter user @iTulga. “If a minister’s sibling Bat engineer is arrested, some nobody like us will just go hoop #FreeBAT,” said another, @BaagiiJr Local free expression advocates also expressed their dismay at the ruling. Khashkhuu Naranjargal, executive director of Globe International, described the case as “a brutal action… completely against freedom of expression standards an	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=11516
Summary of President Xi Jinping’s state visit to Mongolia	Chinese President Xi Jinping, his wife Peng Liyuan, and other official Chinese representatives paid a two-day state visit to Mongolia from August 21 to 22, at the invitation of Mongolian President Ts.Elbegdorj. President Ts.Elbegdorj welcomed the Chinese representatives: “I extend to Your Excellencies President Xi Jinping and Mrs. Peng Liyuang, and distinguished guests, my sincere welcome to Mongolia during this historic visit, which heralds a new page in bilateral relations between our countries.” During the visit, approximately 30 agreements, memoranda and contracts were signed between the governments, government authorities, enterprises and companies, namely for issues concerning the economy, trade and transport sectors, and upgrading Mongolia-China bilateral relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership. “Great things may be done by mass effort. China is willing to provide the opportunity and space for common development with neighboring countries, including Mongolia, so that they may benefit from China’s development,” stated the Chinese President. At the State Ceremonial Ger, the two presidents had a private conversation, where the Mongolian President made several propositions for cooperation in the production and gasification of coal, increasing the number of goods from Asia to Europe passing through Mongolia to 100 million tons by 2020, enhancing transit railway performance for Russia, Mongolia and China, and support for Mongolia’s bid to join APEC. He also emphasized tax-free and unlimited export of goods, especially those from the agricultural sector. In response, President Xi Jinping agreed to take the propositions into consideration, guaranteed to support Mongolia’s membership in APEC, and invited President Ts.Elbegdorj to partake in APEC’s high level meeting in China in September. The Chinese side also mentioned their willingness to cooperate in the energy sector by partnering the construction and operation of a coal power plant and importing coal, and showed interest in signing a Russia-Mongolia-China transit transport agreement and developing a China-Mongolia-Europe transit transport system. On the final day of his two-day state visit to Mongolia, Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered a speech to a special session of the Mongolian parliament, underlining that Mongolia-China relations had entered their best period in history and pointing out the significance of signing a comprehensive strategic partnership, the peak of bilateral relations. Mongolian President Ts.Elbegdorj, MPs, Head of the Diplomatic Corps, and other Mongolian officials, as well as the Chinese delegation, were present at the special parliamentary session. Analysts say the first state visit in 11 years by the head of the Chinese state to Mongolia contributed considerably to solving many issues concerning sea ports, new routes for railway, the trade volume of commodities, duration of agreements and facilitations, and created an opportunity for the two presidents to exchange views on a broad range of international and regional issues of mutual interest.

Amgalan Power Plant to provide heat and energy soon	By Ch.Khaliun The Cabinet resolved financing of 3.9 billion MNT necessary for test heating through the plant’s network. The PM instructed Chairman of Development Bank N.Munkhbat to immediately transfer the funds, and Chairman of Mongolian Customs B.Tsengel to expand the temporary customs procedures period and eliminate taxes for two trucks that will transport ash from the facility. Authorities of the Ministry of Roads and Transportation, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Energy were tasked with immediately obtaining substitute locomotives for coal transportation. UB Mayor E.Bat-Uul was made responsible for taking measures to relocate more than ten households that are adjacent to the plant’s fence and directly interfere with the activities of the plant. The Office of Media and Public Relations of the Cabinet reported that the PM emphasized the necessity for intensifying winter preparedness and allowing UB residents to comfortably overcome winter. News.mn spoke with Minister of Energy D.Zorigt regarding the new thermal power plant. How many complaints are delivered to the Energy Ministry regarding poor power and heat supply? Due to increased population and settlement in UB, heat distribution is becoming inefficient. Many citizens and entities address the Ministry regarding this issue. We don’t have such options to provide heat everywhere, but commissioning the Amgalan plant will improve the situation, providing heat to households living in the eastern side of the city. The workload of the central heating system will decrease as well through the commissioning of the eastern heating network. Problems for households near Zaisan with heat supply deficiencies will be resolved. How about the winter preparedness of the energy sector? Winter preparedness and extensive maintenance work is in progress. Over 1,400 projects will be complete according to the data. Currently, winter preparedness is ongoing at 50 percent completion. Recently, changes were made to the energy tariffs, and the law on energy has been amended. Now it provides the opportunity for the central and eastern region power systems to work without any financial losses for the first time. I see that revenue can cover expenses now. While the western and southern regions will still work at a loss, it is because of imported energy from foreign countries. In the future we will liberalize the tariffs and policies of the energy sector. On the other hand, we do believe that following a flexible policy for households with low income and low power consumption will mitigate the sector’s losses in the next few years. We are regulating price tariffs in order to lower inefficiency. We will save over 15 billion MNT in expenses, tightening our belt, and mitigating the sector’s losses by the end of this year. The price of energy from Russia is increasing. Will the increase continue in the future? Because we import energy from foreign countries, we negotiate on their proposed prices. Unfortunately the price is increasing every six months. However, we need to import energy in the next few years. We need to commission our own energy resources as soon as possible. Rumors were going around about privatizing energy companies? They won’t be fully privatized, but made public. They will be able to raise additional shares at the stock exchange and investors and individuals can buy shares. In other words, they will work as open joint stock companies. Can citizens overcome winter without worry after the commissioning of the Amgalan plant? We are ensuring necessary preparedness to provide consumers with reliable energy this winter.

Director of Liberty Partners Ch.Ganbat wanted by Interpol	By CH.KHALIUN The International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) is in pursuit of Mongolian citizen Ch.Ganbat, who is wanted by the judicial authorities of Mongolia and accused of money laundering and appropriation of property by fraud. Ch.Ganbat served as an advisor to the former Minister of Roads, Transportation, Construction and Urban Development, Kh.Battulga. Ganbat, current director of financial and legal advisory firm Liberty Partners, is being investigated for a case involving B.Batzaya, former state secretary of the Ministry of Roads and Transportation. B.Batzaya was arrested on the suspicion of embezzlement on October 30. He served as the former head of Mongolian Railway’s managing board, and he participated in choosing the contractor for the 267 km railroad connecting Ukhaakhudag to Gashuunsukhait. Ch.Ganbat was the head of the working group selecting investors for the Tavan Tolgoi Project. He was also a member of the working group for monitoring the implementation of railway policy at the time. Some sources say that Ch.Ganbat’s involvement in the case may be related to holding the simultaneous positions. McKinsey & Company, BNP Paribas Corporate & Investment Banking, and Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman were selected for advisory services team members for Tavan Tolgoi, but while funds were being distributed from Chinggis Bonds, Liberty Partners joined the consulting team. As founder of Liberty Partners, Ch.Ganbat owns 85 percent of the company, and the remaining 15 percent is owned by Liberty Management Trust, an entity owned by the management team of Liberty Partners. Former deputy chairman of Mongolian Railway P.Bat-Erdene was planning to complete the construction of the Ukhaakhudag to Gashuunsukhait railroad’s infrastructure through private funding from Energy Resources, but former Minister B.Battulga transferred the project to Mongolian Railway. Although around 200 million USD was issued from Chinggis Bond funding, the project remains incomplete. Some local media reports say that Ganbat may be in Singapore. Currently, nine Mongolian citizens are wanted by Interpol for crimes involving murder, fraud, and embezzlement. N.Enkhtuya, sister of former president of Mongolia N.Enkhbayar, is also on Interpol’s wanted list.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=16873
Widow of assassinated democratic revolutionary arrested	By E.OYUNDARI, M.OYUNGEREL The police arrested widow of the late politician and democratic revolutionary S.Zorig, D.Bulgan, on November 13 for reasons that have not been made public. D.Bulgan was arrested in her home on the night of November 13, according to a report by the police. After 72 hours in police custody, law enforcement authorities extended her detention by two weeks. The police said they are interrogating her while she is detained, but declined to elaborate on why she was arrested, as they stated that the investigation is ongoing. According to unofficial sources, D.Bulgan is being investigated for concealing information about S.Zorig’s murder and giving false statements about her husband’s death in court 17 years ago. Unofficial sources claim that two 40-year-old men were arrested in Erdenet about one month ago in connection to the death of S.Zorig. Earlier, Swiss parliamentarian and member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union’s Committee on the Human Rights of Parliamentarians, Margret Kiener Nellen, during a four-day mission to Mongolia in September 2015, called for the Mongolian authorities to redouble their efforts to resolve what is widely believed to have been a political assassination. Despite 25 years of democratic progress in Mongolia, the unsolved murder of parliamentarian and former Minister of Infrastructure S.Zorig 17 years ago has eroded confidence in the rule of law, said one member of an Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) human rights mission to Mongolia. The perpetrators have still not been brought to justice, despite an ongoing investigation since his death. The lack of progress on the case has been a source of concern for the IPU Committee, which has been engaging with Mongolian authorities over the years to shed more light on the investigation. “Only transparency on the investigation and real progress on the case will reassure people that there is a political will to find out who killed S.Zorig and why,” said Kiener Nellen. “As Mongolia celebrates the 25th anniversary of the first democratic elections in the country, it would be an ideal time to finally resolve the killing of the man who had led the democratic movement in the 1990s.” S.Zorig was brutally murdered in his home in October 1998. It is believed that two assailants entered his apartment, tied up his wife D.Bulgan, and waited for S.Zorig’s arrival. As soon as Zorig stepped through the door they attacked him, stabbing him sixteen times, including three stab wounds to the heart. D.Bulgan: My husband did not wear any masks The one and only known living witness to S.Zorig’s murder is his wife, D.Bulgan. The following is an interview with the widow conducted by journalist R.Davaajav after the tragic murder in 1998. It is believed to be the only interview D.Bulgan gave for public access. Somebody mentioned that you and S.Zorig lived very happily, yet too short. Some people might get jealous, but such happiness is not gifted to everyone. I used to tell my husband that we were living too happily, and told him that I was worried whether such happiness would end sometime. He used to reply that our happiness would not end and promised me we would live together happily until we got old. He dreamt of becoming a mountain ranger when we grew old and retired. We really imagined our future of becoming mountain rangers. I used to daydream about preparing food and taking care of my mountain ranger. We dreamt of living in a log house that we built, and to have one cow so that we could have milk tea every day, and to breed chickens and plant vegetables. He loved reading, playing chess, and laughing with his friends. We dreamt of always doing what we loved when we grew older together [cries]. People say that you do not take taxis, saving money, and some claim that they have even seen you walking with torn shoes. I don’t care. Our family doesn’t have anything to spend on fancy items. I look for places with cheaper prices. I used to spend most of my time looking fo	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=16927

By Sarah Munson I have been a teacher for several years and have seen a lot in that time, but one can always count on gaining new experiences in Mongolia. Recently I had a first. A teacher at the school I work at told me not to give books to her students, the first graders. Why not, you ask? The reason she gave me was “Because they can’t read yet.” I am still stunned by that request. It became clear to me at that moment that the importance of making reading an enjoyable activity from a young age is not widely understood in the Mongolian education system. Mongolians have a tradition of greatly valuing books and respecting literature, poetry, and erudition. Unfortunately, this respect seems to put reading on too high a pedestal and, perversely, manifests itself in the form of programs that discourage the idea of reading as a fun or leisurely educational activity. Kindergarten and elementary school teachers do not read out loud to their students, and therefore do not encourage reading from an early age. And although there is class time mandated for guided reading among students in higher grades, it seems to me that the books are selected to bore even dedicated readers like myself. Our school has a library with several hundred books, but it is sadly under-utilized. It is rarely open, it is housed in a very cold room in an old building next to the school, and it primarily consists of moldy books in Russian or equally impenetrable tomes in English dedicated to topics such as graduate level biochemistry. Interesting books that teachers do keep in their rooms are often viewed as status symbols and are kept behind glass doors or in locked cabinets to keep them safe from the wear and tear of students’ hands. In the few cases when teachers do wish to supply their students with books for reading, they find it difficult to assign entire classes the same book because books are very expensive. I place a very high value on reading and believe that instilling a love of reading is one of the most important ways a teacher can influence students in terms of long term educational success. This belief is based on the findings of research by education experts such as J. T. Guthrie and A. Wigfield who have shown that when students become engaged readers, they thereby give themselves learning opportunities that are equivalent to many years of education. Recognizing the importance of encouraging reading, I established a small library in my classroom. With a grant from a non-profit organization called Friends of Mongolia, and donations from family members and friends, I have been able to build a collection of over 150 Mongolian language novels, comics, history, adventure, and reference books. I may be an English teacher, but I am pragmatic enough to recognize that no student is going to try to read a book in a foreign language until they enjoy reading in their native language. Therefore, in addition to teaching English, I act as a part time librarian, checking out 30 to 40 books a day. My bookshelves may be constantly disorganized and the books may need to be taped back together regularly due to wear and tear, but seeing how excited kids get when they find a coveted copy of “Super Friends: Dinosaur City” on the shelves makes it worthwhile. My library patrons are in grades 2 to 11 and include both boys and girls, “good” students and “bad”, and an ever i	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=3111
Minister L.Bold finds great importance in hosting Ministerial Conference	By E.Dari The Board Meeting of member countries of the Community of Democracies (CD) was held in Geneva on February 26. The Foreign Affairs Minister of Mongolia, L.Bold, opened the high-level Board Meeting where he stressed that Mongolia is finding great importance in hosting the CD Ministerial Conference and expressed his enthusiasm that invited countries were at the conference, and especially thanked the Board Member countries for sending their foreign ministers. Japanese Foreign Minister Toshiko Abe attended the opening meeting and gave a statement that Japan would actively participate in the operations of CD and support the initiation of a working group that fosters democracy in countries such as Cambodia and Myanmar, which are now in the throes of the Democratic Movement. During this Board Meeting, an important decision was made to invite more countries to attend the Ministerial Conference, which will be hosted in Ulaanbaatar. Later on, the delegations of Mongolia gave information on their preparations for this conference; such as the draft conference program, the draft of the Ulaanbaatar Independence project, and the participation status of invited countries. Furthermore, the working groups of the CD mentioned their relevant duties and discussed the regulation on choosing the chair country of the CD. The Board members also promoted the idea of forming a working group of to advance the Democratic Movement in South Sudan, with the Permanent Representative of South Sudan to Geneva, Mr. R. Riek, informing them that South Sudan is glad with this decision. The meeting was attended by the senior officials of the Board Member countries, CD Secretary-General Maria Leissner, and representatives of civil society. Mongolia has been chairing the CD since July 2011, for almost two years; and is working to host its 7th Ministerial Conference from April 27 to 29. The CD is an intergovernmental organization established in 2000. The Community works to strengthen democracy worldwide by providing support to emerging democracies and civil society. It now embraces almost 140 countries, including a governmental component made up of government representatives and a non-governmental component made up of civil society organizations. The Foreign Affairs Ministries of around 150 countries and around twenty international organizations have been invited to the upcoming CD Ministerial Conference in Ulaanbaatar. The President of Mongolia himself has invited over ten heads of foreign states and governments, and has since invited the same number of world-famous and prominent personalities. The actual Ministerial Conference will be held on April 29, and the previous two days, April 27 and 28, will be dedicated to the Parliamentary Summit of CD, Women Summit, Youth Summit, and the Conference of Civil Society. Currently, some heads of states have already responded to the invitation to attend this Ulaanbaatar conference. Foreign ministries of ten countries and four international organizations have also agreed to take part in the Ministerial Conference. It is estimated that around a thousand foreign delegations will come to Ulaanbaatar to witness this event. The National Committee to make arrangements to the CD Ministerial Conference is headed by the Prime Minister of Mongolia, N.Altankhuyag.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=3148
Prime Minister chats with citizens through social network	By E.DARI Many proposals and requests regarding health, quality of life, and development projects such as to build of jogging and cycling trails, to decrease the rent of sports halls, to develop entertainment places for the youth, and to award the best alcohol-free city district and street were heard on the “New Morning Ideas” online interview with the Prime Minister of Mongolia, N.Altankhuyag. Premier N.Altankhuyag has decided to start listening to citizen’s voices and new ideas every Friday morning. The third morning interview with N.Altankhuyag was conducted last Friday from 8 to 10 am and around five thousand people opened the www.zasag.mn website and watched the Prime Minister’s live interview. Around six hundred people from Ulaanbaatar as well as Khuvsgul, Khovd, Uvs, Orkhon, Uvurkhangai, and Zavkhan provinces got connected to witness the online interview. They also made their proposals and requests heard through Facebook, Twitter, email, and Yahoo Messenger. Majority of the requests made and issues raised were about building satellite city of Ulaanbaatar, the sanitation of public toilets, the lack of organization to protect citizens’ rights, decreasing the number of night clubs and the sale of alcoholic beverages, and the lack of traffic signs in local roads. Feedback was also expressed such as it is a right decision to develop the provincial centers to halt the massive migration to Ulaanbaatar, to take certain measures against state officials who embezzled money by abusing their positions, and to wish goodwill to N.Altankhuyag and the Government of Innovation and Reform. The Prime Minister then responded to the questions and inquiries from the citizens and gave detailed information about the government’s current projects and the implementations to be made starting this spring. This online interview was aired via Mongolian National Broadcaster Television and FM radio stations, reaching live to local and provincial residents.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=3185
Housing Agency opens in Ulaanbaatar	By Ch.KHALIUN Last week, Housing Agency opened at Misheel Expo’s building materials market to provide the public with information related to housing and listings for available real estate. There are over 250 companies engaged in construction activities in Ulaanbaatar. However, residents say they don’t have enough information about these companies, and they claim that because of a lack of information they make poor choices when making real estate purchases. Residents have also complained that there isn’t any source of integrated information about mortgage loans. The newly opened Housing Agency will provide the public with comprehensive information related to housing, locations, prices, quality, and financing. News.mn spoke with the Chairman of Housing Agency, G.Batsukh, regarding its activities. How will Housing Agency operate? We opened the agency to provide the public with integrated housing information, and to support the activities of construction companies. Professional personnel will provide visitors with information and advice about housing and mortgage loan programs. What about the preparedness of the agency? Are construction companies still being registered and how many companies have been registered and the delivered their information to the agency so far? The preparedness of the agency is almost fully complete. We are now completing maintenance work. Companies are still delivering their proposals. Currently, we plan to register over 100 companies, and their registration is ongoing at 50 percent completion. We will finish registration this week. Construction companies are very interested in including their information in the listings. Will you also offer information about older residences and rental properties? How will you register them? First we will work toward supporting construction companies that are building new apartments. In the second stage, we plan to collect information about older apartments being sold. Property owners can submit information about their rental properties, too. How will you provide services? Will there be any fees charged? Services will be provided for free. People will need to deliver a request to Housing Agency to get the information they are looking for. We can say that the agency will be very useful for people interested in purchasing an apartment.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19133
Mining suppliers underline challenges at the nation’s biggest mining and oil expo	By Ch.KHALIUN During the three-day Mongolia Mining 2016 International Mining & Oil Expo, launched on Wednesday at Buyant Ukhaa Sports Palace, mining suppliers talked about challenges facing the nation’s mining sector. Authorities from the Ministry of Mining, Mongolian National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MNCCI), Erdenes Mongol, and the expo organizing committee presented opening remarks after a traditional music performance by the State Morin Khuur Ensemble. On the first day of the expo, Erdenes Mongol, Erdenet Mining Corporation, Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi, and Shivee Ovoo gave presentations about their procurement policies, coal sector outlooks, and operational plans. The expo participants underlined that suppliers are facing challenges as the nation’s mining sector is slowing down. Sales Manager of Everdigm Mongolia M.Munkhzul said, “Prices for mining equipment rose, following the exchange rate increases of foreign currencies. This has a negative impact on mining equipment sales. Companies prefer renting equipment rather than purchasing.” M.Munkzul pointed out that there are over ten companies in addition to Everdigm Mongolia which offer mining equipment from South Korean conglomerate Doosan. During the second day of the expo, Oyu Tolgoi presented the company’s procurement policy, after which United Belaz Machinery LLC, Wagner Asia Equipment LLC, Sany Group, and Nipigormash introduced their company activities to the expo’s visitors. The expo features 120 indoor and outdoor booths with exhibitors from 15 countries. The exhibitors are displaying and promoting products and services for heavy mining and construction machinery; spare parts; and equipment for drilling and processing factories, reclamation plants, mining camps, supply chains, and transportation. Today, representatives from the Mineral Resources Authority will speak about issuing licenses for gold deposits and other exploration projects. Afterwards, a seminar on Mongolian gold projects will take place, highlighting the present and future potential of the gold sector. The closing ceremony of Mongolia Mining 2016 is being held at 2:30 p.m. today. The expo is being organized by Minex Mongolia, Expo Mongolia, and the International Expo Bureau of Mongolia with support from the Ministry of Mining, MNCCI, and the Mineral Resources Authority of Mongolia.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19164
PM Ch.Saikhanbileg says ‘Mongolia is back to business’	By Ch.KHALIUN Prime Minister Ch.Saikhanbileg emphasized in official meetings held during last week’s Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference (AIC) in Hong Kong that “Mongolia is back to business”. In a speech given at the AIC, the PM stressed that even though the nation’s economy faced difficulties in 2015, the government has moved forward on some of the nation’s mega projects, advancing the country’s economy. He introduced the conference attendees to the nation’s current economic situation, stable political conditions, and measures being taken for drawing in investment. Ch.Saikhanbileg noted that in July, Mongolia will host the 11th Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) Summit, gathering state leaders from 53 countries. He added that he hopes Mongolia will greatly contribute to boosting ties between Asia and Europe by organizing the summit. “Throughout history, Mongolia was a bridge between Asia and Europe, and it still connects these continents by railways and airways. I am confident that the cooperation between Asia and Europe will strengthen as a result of the summit,” Ch.Saikhanbileg said. After his speech, Ch.Saikhanbileg, President of Mongol Bank N.Zoljargal, State Secretary of the Foreign Affairs Ministry D.Gankhuyag, State Secretary of the Finance Ministry Kh.Gantsogt, Consul-General of Mongolia to Hong Kong B.Otgonjargal, Director of Development Bank N.Munkhbat, and Executive Director of Erdenes Mongol B.Byambasaikhan met with Director of Loan Syndication at Credit Suisse Saurabh Banglani, Deputy Director of Credit Suisse Ali Alam, and other Credit Suisse representatives. During the meeting, the PM underlined that Mongolia has been cooperating with Credit Suisse since 2014. Ch.Saikhanbileg noted that Credit Suisse was the first coordinator for a joint loan program with 300 million USD in financing. He added that big projects and programs for import substitution industrialization were launched with the financing. Ch.Saikhanbileg pointed out that the Cabinet and Credit Suisse managed to raise 750 million USD by issuing bonds and joint credit in a short period of time, and exchanged views on broadening mutually-beneficial cooperation with Credit Suisse authorities. On Thursday, Ch.Saikhanbileg called on Chief Executive of Hong Kong Leung Chun-ying to evaluate the current cooperation between Mongolia and Hong Kong, and to discuss possibilities for future cooperation. Ch.Saikhanbileg said that collaboration between the two parties is expanding, and underlined that the Hong Kong Trade Development Council is playing a key role in supporting economic and investment ties between Mongolia and Hong Kong. The PM also mentioned collaboration between the Mongolian Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and highlighted the significance of boosting cooperation in the stock market. At the end of the meeting, the parties agreed to organize an exhibition to promote Mongolia in Hong Kong. Concluding his visit to Hong Kong and participation in the AIC, the PM said that the conference was a great opportunity for presenting the nation’s economic and financial situation, investment potential, and business environment. The PM emphasized, “One of priorities of the Mongolian government is allowing Mongolians to become owners of wealth from mineral resources, and to create a fund of wealth by transmitting Erdenes Mongol into a Singaporean Temasek model. We met with investors who can collaborate with Mongolia on this matter. The Nobel Fund and Canada’s Pension Fund expressed interest in cooperation.” Ch.Saikhanbileg concluded that the purpose of his visit had been fulfilled successfully. He emphasized that investors are still interested in Mongolia, and Mongolia managed to deliver its message that the country is still friendly to foreign investors.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19215
World Bank suggests diversifying the Mongolian economy	By Ch.KHALIUN In their East Asia and Pacific Update, World Bank underlined that Mongolia needs to focus on implementing sustainable and smart policies for diversifying the nation’s economy. World Bank (WB) noted that if Mongolia’s economy keeps weakening, the country will face a significant economic recession. World Bank economists suggested that Mongolia discuss the economic difficulties domestically, but not to resolve the issue by expanding budgets. They warn that if the current business environment distortion and policies on social welfare are not revised immediately, Mongolia will continue seeing financial risk and crisis. World Bank highlighted that Mongolia’s economy faces short-term challenges from a fragile external environment and large external debt repayments with limited policy buffers. World Bank said that Mongolia’s mining GDP grew 13 percent on the back of strong production at the Oyu Tolgoi mine. Non-mining GDP declined by 0.8 percent, reflecting subdued domestic demand. Growth in agriculture was maintained at 10.7 percent. Manufacturing growth slowed to 1.3 percent, and wholesale and retail services and construction growth fell by 3.6 percent and 1.4 percent respectively. Exports dropped 36 percent in the last quarter of 2015, followed by a 30.4 percent decline in January. Total imports fell by 19.5 percent in January, following a 21 percent drop in the three previous months, with oil product imports halving. Sharp import compression turned the current account into a 24 million USD surplus in January, from a deficit of 130 million USD in the previous three months, according to the WB’s report. The balance of payments recorded a 21.7 million USD surplus in January, following a 95.6 million USD deficit in the last three months of 2015. World Bank believes that a moderate current account surplus and a currency swap facility with China helped ease the balance of payments pressure in January. Foreign direct investment toward Mongolia remained weak, displaying a 26.7 million USD net inflow in January. Gross international reserves declined to nearly 1.2 billion USD in February from 1.3 billion USD at the end of 2015, indicating escalating balance of payments pressure in February. The MNT rate depreciated by 2.5 percent against the USD in the first three months of 2016, following highly limited movement in the last four months of 2015. The WB report also underlined that the nation’s budget revenues declined by 5.4 percent compared to 2014 amid slowing growth and falling imports. Facing continued pressure on balance of payments and revenues, the government announced that a 250 million USD five-year loan had been secured through a syndicated loan facility in March. Outlook growth is projected to slow to 0.7 percent in 2016. Non-mining production will gradually recover with OT’s second-phase investment. Mining production is projected to decline due to weaker external demand and lower-grade ores to be tapped by the OT mine. Inflation is expected to stay moderate amid a slow recovery in demand and lower oil prices. Weak growth in key labor-intensive sectors, such as construction and retail services, would have adverse welfare impacts, particularly among wage-dependent urban households, according to the WB report. World Bank says that priority should be given to reducing external and fiscal vulnerabilities by deepening policy adjustment. The fiscal policy should stay the course on reducing the budget deficit and managing the public debt at a sustainable level. Monetary policy should stay focused on maintaining price stability, avoiding quasi-fiscal programs, and reducing external vulnerabilities by allowing a flexible exchange rate adjustment and safeguarding reserve buffers. The East Asia and Pacific Update noted that weak economic prospects in the near term indicate the growing risk that many households close to the poverty line may slide back into poverty. To preserve poverty gains under tight fiscal constraints, the W	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19244
Erdenes OT’s Executive Director says hundreds of Mongolians will be hired starting in July	By Ch.KHALIUN In an interview with News.mn, Executive Director of Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi D.Ganbold spoke about Oyu Tolgoi’s underground mine project and emphasized that starting in July the company will hire hundreds of Mongolians for the mine’s expansion. He said that the underground mine’s development launched in December 2015, after the signing of a financial agreement for the mine’s expansion. “Some work even started before signing the agreement. The Mongolian side pressured for intensifying the underground mine’s development by March. However, negotiations with 14 international banks have started recently. Everything is ongoing in accordance with our plans.” Ganbold said that the process of spending financing from the International Finance Corporation has started. “Other banks will distribute financing according to their timetables. Some of the financing will be deposited next year. We will spend the money over a couple of years. It doesn’t mean that all of the money will be distributed at once. We need to understand everything properly,” underlined Ganbold. He said that the underground mine’s operations have commenced and the company is in the process of ordering necessary equipment. “Journalists always ask only about when the financing will be deposited, so do politicians. When any of the big projects move forward, they always pay attention to when the financing will be distributed to the state budget,” Ganbold claimed. He underlined that OT’s underground mine development will be carried out for at least two to three years. He emphasized that when Oyu Tolgoi starts hiring Mongolian workers in July, that the Mongolian economy will start seeing benefits from the project. The government claims that the interest rate for the low interest housing loan program will be lowered to five percent once one billion USD in financing for OT has been issued. D.Ganbold stressed that only politicians and journalists create such expectations among the public. “Politicians make statements to attract attention from many people, and then journalists spread the news. Politicians and journalists greatly influence society, but they can’t be talking about financing distribution without understanding economic principles,” noted Ganbold. “Even though there are reports that Mongolia’s economy has grown by one billion USD every year following the launch of the OT mine, it doesn’t mean that the money went into Finance Minister B.Bolor’s pocket. I don’t know how to explain it more clearly,” he said. “We could say that Mongolia doesn’t produce anything. When we purchase necessary equipment for the mine operations being carried out at depths of greater than 1,000 meters for 500 million USD, it means that not even one USD remains in Mongolia. The money will come to Mongolia in taxes once the equipment crosses the Mongolian border.” Ganbold said that first stage of investment for the underground mine will be spent on equipment. “This is a business that requires many pieces of equipment. We will start purchasing products from domestic companies. Many domestic companies will be responsible for sand, gravel, concrete, and cement supply, and for food and clothes for workers. It can be understood that a tremendous amount of money will come to Mongolia. We all know that OT’s first project was greatly beneficial for us. At that time, the nation’s economy grew by 17 percent, and within less than ten years, almost everyone bought cars and many new buildings were constructed. Not only thanks to Oyu Tolgoi, but Tavan Tolgoi and other mines created under the Long-named Law contributed to the economic growth. Unfortunately, we were lifted by our small success and everyone became an environmental ranger. As a result, we did stop the operations of many mines over the last few years. But we don’t have anyone to complain to. We were all involved in this issue somehow, no foreigner came to Mongolia and instructed us. Around 60 to 70 percent of today’s crisis was created by us	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19278
Mongolia India Business Council opens to support businesses	By Ch.KHALIUN Last Friday, Mongolia India Business Council (MIBC) was established to support the businesses of the two countries and help in expanding their cooperation. At the opening ceremony of the council, President of the MIBC B.Gantulga said that Mongolia has been importing only religious items and souvenirs from India. He noted that some of India’s biggest companies have expressed interest in investing in Mongolia’s engineering infrastructure. He said, “During his state visit to Mongolia paid last year, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that India will consistently support Mongolia in every sector. In order to develop the trade and economic cooperation between the two countries, we are establishing the MIBC at the initiative of Indian entrepreneurs.” “In recent years, the electronics business is developing around the world. In addition to importing religious items and souvenirs, we are interested in cooperating to develop e-commerce between the two states. Any kind of business relationship develops based on mutual trust. That’s why our council will provide the two countries’ businesses with real and current market information.” Honorary President of the MIBC O.Nyamdavaa pointed out that 95 years have passed since Mongolia and India established diplomatic relations. “During this time, political and cultural relations and cooperation of Mongolia and India have been intensively developing. First Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru consistently supported Mongolia in joining the UN. Last year, Prime Minister Modi paid his first official visit to Mongolia. The visit was crucial in taking the strategic cooperation of the two countries to a new level. Involving the private sectors of the two states is important in advancing economic cooperation between Mongolia and India. The MIBC will work toward providing support in this matter.” During the council’s opening ceremony, Mongolian representatives and Executive Director of the MIBC Surendra Kumar Bansal spoke about current economic cooperation between Mongolia and India. It was noted that even though trade turnover between the two countries has been reaching around 50 to 60 million USD per year, the volume has decreased since 2010. In 2014, trade turnover fell to 15 million USD, which the MIBC believes should be improved. Executive Director Bansal said that if Mongolian products are being sold abroad in countries like the U.S. and France, they can also be exported to India, highlighting that India is one of the biggest retail markets in the world. Bansal said that the council will conduct studies on which Mongolian brands can be introduced to the Indian market, and what kind of activities Indian businesses can carry out in Mongolia. He said that the council will present the results of their studies and provide Mongolian and Indian businesses with information about mutually beneficial business opportunities. Bansal underlined, “We could say that India is a country of farming. Farmers make up around 70 percent of the country’s population… We will study possibilities for introducing Indian farming experience and equipment to Mongolia.” “Mongolia can supply wool and cashmere products to India. The country can also supply food products, including meat and meat products, but processed as sausages. The world believes that Mongolian food products are organic and healthy. Not only in India, but in the region, there is a water shortage. That’s why we should also study the possibility of supplying pure water from Mongolia,” Bansal noted. He emphasized that Mongolian food products will meet India’s quarantine standards, but that beef export will not be an option.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19330
Mongolia to spend India’s one billion USD loan on infrastructure	By Ch.KHALIUN During his state visit to Mongolia last year, Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi promised to provide one billion USD in loans. Mongolian Mining Journal interviewed Minister of Foreign Affairs L.Purevsuren about details on the loan agreement and plans for spending. Last May, India said that it would provide a one billion USD loan to Mongolia. What will it be used for? In May 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid an official visit to Mongolia. During the visit, the prime ministers of Mongolia and India held official negotiations and exchanged views on expanding cooperation and relations between the two countries. Prime Minister Modi reported that the Government of India had decided to open a one billion USD credit line for ensuring Mongolia’s economic growth, based on the importance of Mongolia’s infrastructure sector development. This is a long-term concessional loan. Does the Indian side have any requirements for the loan’s conditions and spending? Since 1990, Mongolia has taken out 27.5 million USD in concessional loans from India, which makes up one percent of the nation’s total concessional loans. Prime Minister Modi underlined that the loan will be issued for the nation’s infrastructure sector. The Indian side proposed a concessional loan with a 1.5 percent annual interest rate and an eight-year repayment period. At the beginning of April, government representatives from the Cabinet Secretariat, Finance Ministry, Foreign Affairs Ministry, and Roads and Transportation Ministry visited Delhi to negotiate with the Indian side on softening the loan conditions. As a result, the concessional loan will issued for a 25-year period with a 1.75 percent annual interest rate, and Mongolia will be exempt from repaying the principal payment of the loan for the first seven years after receiving funds. We are now working toward establishing the general loan agreement. We are planning to spend the money on infrastructure, especially in the railroad sector. Are there any other loans or financial assistance that will be provided to Mongolia in 2016? In addition to the concessional loan from India, we are negotiating on a one billion USD loan from China’s Exim Bank. The issue of taking out loans from Asian Development Bank, World Bank, and other international banks and financial organizations remains open. These issues will be regulated in accordance with the Law on Debt Management.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19359
Integrated e-data system launched in the mining sector	By Ch.KHALIUN The Mining Ministry reported on the launch of the electronic data system of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), and highlighted that all information related to the nation’s mining sector, including special licenses, production, sales, tax payments, donations, and support, are now centralized and available to the public. Mongolia first joined the EITI in 2006, and since then has been publishing EITI reports for international and domestic audiences. The Ministry reported that since 2006, a total of 4,701 entities engaged in mining, oil, and uranium activities have released reports, making transparent information about company tax contributions. The government has reported on tax income from 6,858 entities. Mining sector representatives underlined that when they were publishing their reports on paper, it required many materials and was time consuming, that the reports weren’t always accurate, and the value of the information and access to it was poor. From 2014 to 2015, Interactive LLC has been implementing the project to introduce the EITI electronic reporting system in Mongolia, with assistance from the Adam Smith International Institute, to provide integrated electronic EITI reports to the public and to improve the comprehensive reporting of mining sector information. Information Technology Advisor of the EITI G.Ganbat said, “We started conducting studies on the electronic reporting system in 2013. In April 2014, the system processing work started and was successfully completed within five months. Staring from January 2015, we started receiving EITI reports, and the second stage of the work started in September 2015 and is now ongoing.” Senior Counsel from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Paul Moffatt underlined, “Our bank has been consistently supporting the EITI over the past few years. We are grateful to have cooperated in transforming information into practice.” President of the Mongolian National Mining Association N.Algaa said, “Launching the integrated electronic information database is a great advance. However, consumers do have their own needs and demands. If we could provide information to target groups, that would be better.”	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19406
AmCham Monthly Meeting discusses challenges in the mining sector	By M.OYUNGEREL The American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Mongolia held a panel discussion and a Q&A; session about current challenges in the mining industry and future expectations from it with CEO of Energy Resources LLC G.Battsengel, Economist and Executive Director of Mongolia Oil Shale Association Ch.Khashchuluun, and Chief Economist of Erdenes Mongol LLC and board member of Oyu Tolgoi LLC Ch.Otgochuluu during their Monthly Meeting held on April 20. The meeting was attended by approximately 60 participants, including AmCham members and representatives from the private sector. During the discussion, economist Ch.Khashchuluun said that Mongolia is finally enabling independent operations in the mining sector and looking to diversify the economy. He added that government intervention should be minimized to be open for foreign investment. “What the government should do now is to create possibilities for more investment by preparing more in-detailed geographical maps, promoting exploration in both private and government organizations, and generally doing nothing else,” said G.Khaschuluun. He continued and discussed existing projects, new infrastructure in the Gobi region, the construction of power plants, and the new independent fuel suppliers to Mongolia. Board Member of Oyu Tolgoi LLC Ch.Otgochuluu spoke about the 35 million USD diversification project that the company is implementing with Asian Development Bank. “Erdenes Mongol is currently going thorough governance reform, which will increase our value by three or four times if we manage the transition well,” he said, adding that the company is learning a lot about state ownership and corporate governance by cooperating with International Finance Corporation and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. He emphasized the significance of state owned enterprises which do not compete with the private sector, and added that the Erdenes Mongol board will remain the same regardless of the outcomes of the 2016 election. CEO of Energy Resources LLC G.Battsengel said, “We always focused on our investors and shareholders rather than marketing our company. What is happening at Mongolian Mining Corporation at the moment is just a reflection of what is happening in Mongolia and what is happening in the coal sector globally.” He focused his discussion on the advantages that Mongolia has in the regional market. During the Q&A; session, G.Battsengel said that he predicts it will be three to four years before the completion of railways which will enable more cost effective transit of mining exports.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19409
BCM summit addresses business sector development	By Ch.KHALIUN The Business Council of Mongolia (BCM) held the 1st Annual Business Council of Mongolia Summit last Thursday at Blue Sky Hotel, to discuss and exchange views about how the business community can resolve issues plaguing Mongolia’s business sector under the banner “Supporting sustainable business growth and development in Mongolia”. Executive Director of Erdenes Mongol B.Byambasaikhan presented opening remarks at the meeting. The BCM highlighted that some of Mongolia’s top businesses and analysts spoke at the event, including Board Chairman of American University of Mongolia Peter Morrow, Executive Director of the National Council of Private Sector Support Ch.Khashchuluun, and Chief Executive Officer of Oyu Tolgoi Andrew Woodley. At the summit, Managing Partner of Price Waterhouse and Coopers Mongolia Matthew Pottle gave advice on how businesses can best manage today’s economic slowdown. International Finance Corporation’s Resident Representative for Mongolia Tuyen Nguyen noted that the IFC still has in hand an austerity plan that focuses on cutting unnecessary public spending along with assistance for managing today’s tough economic conditions. “There is room for flexibility,” he said. At the end of the meeting, the summit’s participants presented their conclusions, and President of the Institute for National Strategy Cameron McRae underlined, “Over the past four years, many strange and surprising events took place in Mongolian politics. The government that was said to be amazing was dismissed. Some of the mega projects stopped, while some of them moved forward. We hope that the next government will study prior mistakes and experiences and manage Mongolia with wisdom.” “It is important for the Mongolian government to hear voices from businesses, because the business sector is related to all other sectors. It is important to provide support and assistance to a company’s social issues. Mongolia needs to develop its economy not only based on the mining sector, but support agriculture and cement and lime production. The country needs to finalize the issue of the Tavan Tolgoi to Gashuunsukhait railway. Because [transport] takes so much time, coal competitiveness is weakening,” noted President of Trade and Development Bank of Mongolia Randolph Koppa. The BCM’s Executive Director Jim Dwyer pointed out that the summit provided a unique opportunity that gave participants the chance to deliver their suggestions to the government, as the BCM plans to deliver a summary of the event’s discussion to lawmakers.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19438
NGOs say child jockeys shouldn’t race in commercial winter horse races	By Helen Wright The UB Post reported that a group of children’s rights NGOs and associations had joined forces to try and stop child riders taking part in spring and winter horse races, raising their concerns at a press conference. They say that due to the very cold weather conditions it is not safe for child jockeys, who can be as young as seven years old, to take part. Due to race days and child jockeys can also miss out on important school work, meaning they get left behind in lessons. The NGOs also say that races organized during the winter and spring are not traditional, unlike the races which take place as part of the Naadam Festival in the summer, and are organized for commercial gain. Because of this, they say adults should take part as jockeys rather than children. The UB Post spoke to Amaraa Dorjsambuu, a child protection specialist at UNICEF Mongolia, to find out more about their concerns. Can you tell me about winter racing in Mongolia and why it should be stopped? Our concern is really about children who are riding the horses in winter and spring. These races only started in 2004 and a recent study we commissioned with the Human Rights Commission and Legal Research Center and Bar Association of Mongolia looks into five main issues. 1. Are winter races really part of the culture? 2. Are they in line with national standards? And do we have a legal framework for them? 3. What are the health hazards? 4. How does this affect children’s education? 5. And whether it is a form of hazardous labor? So these are the areas that we looked into. What the report showed is that the legal framework is really missing, there is a big hole, and winter racing is not regulated. First of all, we have the national festival, Naadam in July, which is regulated but there are no such regulations on organizing races in winter or springtime. Secondly, this is not in line with the obligations that the Government of Mongolia has entered into with international conventions. So our recommendation is to really align with international treaties and have the races regulated to ensure children’s rights. If the races are to continue, we strongly urge that it is done so using adults who are over 18, especially when the nature of this racing is becoming more commercial. With this commercial nature, we think the horses should be ridden by adults because there is no tradition of them being ridden by children. This year, mayors of 12 provinces prohibited to organize these racing competitions until May 1. But because there is a government decree that allows them to organize races, people still do and this year, the first race happened on February 28. Were there any problems with the last race that took place? So far we don’t know how many children fell off their horses or got injured, as we have not heard from the national counterparts yet. So far, we know that 19 children fell off their horses but that needs to be verified. We don’t know yet exactly how many got injured or what is the severity of their injuries, so we will follow up on that. And what are the health hazards with winter racing in general? In terms of the health hazards of winter racing, it is happening in a time when it is very cold, and if it is -15 degrees or -20 degrees and a horse is racing at the speed of around 70 kmph, we do not know how a child would feel on a horse. But it would be a lot colder. And the clothing they wear is not fit for winter, we have a standard but that is only for summer racing and we do not have winter suitable clothing for children. They need to be able to put on many layers and then the safety stuff on top of that. And what about the educational problems caused by the races? Can you tell me about that? It has, of course, very negative effects on the children’s education. It does not only effect the day of the race so children have to take a lot of time off school. They need to prepare for several days before that. So on those days, children also miss classes. 	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=18763
Top schools in Ulaanbaatar	Trans. by B.DULGUUN News.mn has released a ranking of the top general education schools in Ulaanbaatar based on results from General Admissions Exams. Countless private schools have been established all around the capital. Many parents are paying good money to have their children attend these schools even though the government offers free education through public schools. Statistics from last year indicate that 100 out of 750 schools in Mongolia are private schools. It also shows that the tuition of private schools range from 1.5 million MNT to 50 million MNT. Besides tuition, the quality of schools is important for parents. Media outlets have disclosed several research materials on the ranking of private schools in the past. Although the materials aren’t official, they are considered quite useful for ranking private schools. However, they reportedly caused some serious violations of student’s interests and their right to choose. Basic shortcomings in the research include the fact that the average scoring of schools were solely based on scores of students who gave the General Admission Exam, a national test used for university admission. The results didn’t state how many high school graduates didn’t give the exam. Authorities say that there were some unpleasant incidents such as restricting students from taking exams of their interest and having former graduates retake the General Admission Exam. News.mn journalists reviewed reports on the 2014 and 2015 General Admission Exams made by the Education Evaluation Center of Mongolia to assess the quality of education provided by Mongolian private and public schools. To prevent violation and improve the quality of the research, General Admission Exam scores of exam takers of each school was calculated as well as the number of graduates of the respective year. For instance, the average mathematics score of students from School No.1 of Ulaanbaatar amounted to 609 points and the school was ranked in 14th place in 2015. The Education Evaluation Center evaluates schools based on their average score from 10 subjects. Something interesting was discovered when a detailed list was made for the results of tests from 10 different subjects of the 2014 and 2015 General Admission Exams. In 2015, Orchlon School came in first place, with an average score of 709 point in all subjects. However, only seven out of 19 students who graduated from Orchlon in 2015 had taken the mathematics exam, while 119 students out of 133 graduates of School No.1 took the same exam in the same year. Looking at this, it can be said that School No.1’s ranking for mathematics is much higher than Orchlon School’s. Specifically, 133 students from School No.1 scored a total of 72,471 points whereas 19 students from Orchlon School earned a total of 4,963 points. If we divide their scores by the number of students who took the exam, the average score for each student of School No.1 is 545, but Orchlon School students’ is 261. School No.1 was ranked in 5th place and Orchlon School in 25, based on this type of comparison. News.mn noted that their ranking of Ulaanbaatar schools is more reliable for parents hoping to choose the best school for their child.

‘If we lose our livestock, we will lose everything’	By HELEN WRIGHT When my sister and I were little, our mum would point out animals in the fields when we were driving on long car journeys. “Look, sheep… Horses… Goats,” she’d say, trying everything and anything to stop the pair of us fighting in the back seat. Now 20 years later, I find myself playing the game driving though the Mongolian steppe. Except it’s not quite the same game. These sheep, goats and horses aren’t cantering through the green fields of rural eastern England. They lie dead where they fell, half covered in snow and ice, sometimes a whole intact carcass, others just white, jutting bones entangled in dirty fleece. These are the victims of the dzud that’s currently affecting most provinces in the country, mainly to the west and north. So far, more than 260,000 animals have died this winter and estimates put the daily death rate at around 1,000. If herders hadn’t slaughtered their animals en masse in the Autumn, the figure would now be in the millions. Dzud is a slow-moving natural disaster and occurs when an abnormally harsh and cold winter follows a summer draught. Due to the lack of rain, there is not enough grass for animals to eat and put on weight for the winter months. This problem is also caused by overgrazing and the lack of grass available to eat. Over four days last week, the UB Post traveled with the Mongolian Red Cross Society (MRCS) and the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) to deliver food aid and cash grants to herding families in Uvs Province, more than 1,300 km west of Ulaanbaatar. Uvs is the second-worst hit province and it hasn’t rained there since July of last year. This winter’s temperatures regularly dropped to -50 degrees Celsius. So far 24,000 animals have died in Uvs alone. Many herders have lost more than half of their livestock, which are their only source of income and are relied upon for milk, meat and heating. Many families have moved multiple times to try and find better pastures but with little success. Herders often live hundreds of kilometers apart and hours from the nearest district center or market. As the livestock death figures rise, many are in despair and have no idea how to save their animals. In Undarkhangai, the MRSC and IFRC handed out essentials such as cereal, wheat flour, rice, sugar, tea, and salt, along with cash grants of 64,000 MNT to families who do not have regular or easy access to markets. Others, who live closer to shops, were given 192,000 MNT. The IFRC launched an emergency appeal in February to raise 830,000 USD to enable the MRCS to help 25,500 people, or around 5,100 families, with food aid, cash grants and new opportunities for 12 months. It will focus on food security, nutrition, community preparedness and risk reduction. Our first visit was to Dogoonoo and her family, who live around 70 km from the provincial center in Tsagaannuur bag. So far, this winter she has lost 210 of her 230 animals. She lives amongst five households and they have lost 500 animals all together from a herd of 800. The majority of the lost animals were sheep and goats, which are less resilient than cows and horses. The 72-year-old has been herding since she retired 17 years ago, and says this is the worst dzud she has experienced. A hundred yards or so from the family gers lies a pile of frozen dead sheep, goats and cows. Some have been skinned and the fleeces sold, but other animals are still intact. Without the fleece it’s easy to see just how thin these animals were. On one side of the pile, two chestnut-colored goats are eating the stomach of a skinned carcass. Some of the remaining animals mill around outside the ger, nuzzling through the dusty ground, looking for something to eat. One goat chews a piece of cardboard. Inside, over milk tea, Dogoonoo explains how hard the winter has been on the family. “We were just catching up from the 2009-2010 dzud, when we lost two-thirds of our animals, when this one happened,” said the mothe	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=18877
The value of human life in Nalaikh	By Allyson Seaborn @allysonseaborn This article was originally published by The Mongolian Observer Magazine. Exposure to fear and hardship increases your resilience, but it doesn’t increase your chances of survival when the walls of a mine shaft are crumbling around you. Resilience means nothing when you cannot breathe and are slowly suffocating dozens of meters below the surface of the Earth. I have thought a lot about fear and what dying must be like since my visit to an illegal coal mine at Nalaikh. I have pondered over what it would be like to perish under mountains of rubble – perhaps slowly, perhaps quickly depending on the sheer force of the material burying you. It would be pitch black and nobody would be able to hear your final scream. Before cramming myself into the rusty vessel which resembled a giant English bathtub from the 19th century, I glance at the dodgy steel cable which will soon guide me downwards. It’s attached to an archaic looking winch. Soon, a man will press a lever and we’ll descend down the precipitous mine shaft. It’s such a small, but ominous opening into the Earth, to where the coal lies. The impulsive part of me orders me not to think about it too much and tells me to just squeeze my eyes tight. I’m freezing cold as I wait for the miner who has volunteered to accompany me on this frightful journey. I’m relieved when I feel him jump in behind me, his boots pressing at my back. It’s just at the start of the descent, perhaps only two meters in, when I start to panic as the tunnel closes in on me. I can barely hear myself shouting, “STOP!” and I realize my companion cannot hear me. Even if he could, I don’t know if it would have been possible for him to halt our descent. If we stopped, what next? Sit crying in a dark tunnel? There is no stopping. This is not a game or a joy ride, and I deeply regret my decision. Upon reflection, this has been the most frightening experience of my life. I am a mouse in a deadly, bleak hole. I feel the thundering grind of the earth underneath the steel bottom of the tub I sit in and hope the winch is strong. I curse profanely and am paralyzed by fear – fear at its pinnacle. This is fear I will never be able to shake. Further and further, my eyes now closed tightly, just waiting. Then, slowing down and finally halting with a dull thud. I know we’ve reached the bottom because my head jolts sharply, the tub is facing down a near vertical slope and I peer into a dimly lit cavern. I feel a pat on my shoulder from behind, a touch that signals I’m going to be ok and can get out now. “Let’s go. Keep it together, Allyson,” I mutter to myself and tear my coat open on a sharp bit of steel. My legs are shaking as I stagger to my feet. Someone is helping me and guiding me. The intense panic has subsided somewhat as I step onto the coal platform 40 meters below to gaze at three men who are holding picks and shovels. They adjust their lanterns and look bewildered by my presence, and then I hear their warm Mongolian greetings and look into their surprised, wide eyes. I touch the jet black walls speckled with brown and grey dirt, where jagged bits of coal beg to be hacked away and unearthed. Everything around me looks shiny and wet against the glow of the faint light, and I run my fingers over the coal face. The cavern is about 25 square meters in area, with varying heights and nooks all around. A toothpick-like beam supports the ceiling in the highest part above us, three old logs and a bit of wire. There isn’t a hope in hell of this beam holding anything up in the event of a collapse. I’m no mining safety expert, but realize the futility of the ridiculous support mechanism above me. The miners with me do not complain. They explain. They have jobs. They’re grateful. They know it’s a dangerous occupation, but what choice do they have? And this is how it works: you chip away at the walls of coal and fill up the tub, and then send the tub full of coal back to the surface. Repeat day in	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=18947
Kh.Battulga’s former assistant addresses letter to President from jail	Trans. by M.OYUNGEREL MP Kh.Battulga’s former assistant G.Tuvshinjargal, who is currently being held in custody for suspected involvement in the Ukhaakhudag-Gashuunsukhait railway project embezzlement case, sent a letter to President Ts.Elbegdorj on March 25, concerning the President’s “biased” statement. In her letter, G.Tuvshinjargal said that she served the Democratic Party and the “democratic President” and that she has supported them since she was able to vote. “I’m writing this letter as I heard from my lawyer that you said ‘Poison and theft should not hide behind mother’s white milk’. I don’t understand how you know that I’m hiding poison and theft with my white milk. I wasn’t found guilty and nor have I committed a crime; but it seems to me that it’s already decided that I will be accused and sentenced because the democratic President that I have been serving for is now proclaiming me as a ‘criminal’,” wrote G.Tuvshinjargal. She also claimed that the state is violating her child’s rights. “I am truly offended to be a sacrifice in a false charge for the democracy that I’ve supported. “I don’t see any other options but to declare a hunger strike to fight against this cruelty. You will probably say again that we don’t have to care. Mongolia is a member of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Children. From what I remember, the convention states, “A country has to support and take all measures to not separate a mother and a child’. Today, my child’s rights are being violated in her home country, and she is being punished at such a young age for a crime her mother didn’t commit.” G.Tuvshinjargal said that she is a victim of those who are trying to sell of the country for quick money. “Protector of the people’s unity and parent to many, President of Mongolia! I am being repressed and separated from my baby, imprisoned for a crime I didn’t commit. They’ve sacrificed and forced a false charge on me, a regular state servant, in their fight. Political and business groups who are trying to trade their country for wealth are using the law enforcement to beat the ones who tried to stop them. “This is really just an imitation of democracy’,” G.Tuvshinjargal concluded. G.Tuvshinjargal was arrested on March 16 under Criminal Code Clause 148.4, a class one felony. On March 18, the Bayanzurkh, Sukhbaatar and Chingeltei District primary courts ruled to keep her in custody for two more weeks regardless of her status as a nursing mother. She is currently being held in custody at the General Executive Agency of Court Decisions’ Detention Center No.461. Source: news.mn	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19034
Mongolia to cut emissions of persistent organic pollutants	Trans. by Ch.KHALIUN Mongolia will implement a project on introducing environmentally-friendly technology and experience to mitigate open burning of waste in relation to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). Unuudur spoke with the project manager, B.Delgerbayar, about the project details. Four countries were involved in this project aside from Mongolia. How long will the project be carried out for? The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and Global Environment Facility (GEF) are going to implement this project in Mongolia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and the Philippines through 2020. The main objective of the project is to mitigate the volume of POPs, such as dioxins and furans, that are emitted when wastes are open burnt by 93 percent. How much financing is required and what measures will be taken under the project? The GEF is investing a total of 7.56 million USD for the project. Approximately 1.5 million USD will be spent in each country. The Ministry of Environment, Green Development and Tourism and Mayor’s Office of Ulaanbaatar will implement the project in Mongolia. They will also implement subprojects on improving the Law on Waste Management to strengthen the skills of personnel of relevant organizations, introduce environmentally-friendly technology for decreasing open burning of waste, and increase the public’s knowledge on impacts of POPs caused by open burning. What are the influences of POPs on human health and animals? What kind of diseases may result from POPs? The main goal of the Stockholm Convention on POPs is to protect human health and the environment. POPs include 26 substances such as chlordane, dieldrin and polychlorinated biphenyls. POPs are widely distributed through the environment as a result of natural processes involving soil, water and, most notably, air. They accumulate in the fatty tissues of living organisms including humans, and are found at higher concentrations at higher levels in the food chain. They are toxic to both humans and wildlife. They have negative impacts on endocrine, immunity, nerves, reproductive system, and may cause skin diseases, diabetes and cancer. POPs also affect fetus development and poison infants through breast milk. How much is the volume of dioxins and furans in Mongolia compared to other countries? Because Mongolia’s territory is big, and the country has a low population density and industry is not developed well, emission of dioxins and furans are relatively low compared to other countries. However, emission of dioxins and furans from centralized waste fields are high. The volume of dioxins and furans emitted from the Moringiin Davaa centralized waste field per year is 10 times higher than Cambodia’s. What causes the emission of dioxins and furans? Dioxins and furans aren’t only emitted when burning wastes. They are also emitted when burning wood and coal in a furnace, cremation, burning of carcasses, and when fire breaks out in forests. Around 50 percent of dioxins and furans emission in Mongolia is caused by open burning of wastes. The main reason is that a great amount of waste are openly burned in centralized waste fields and in illegal waste fields. How many waste fields are there in Mongolia? There are six centralized landfills in Ulaanbaatar, and 357 waste fields in provinces. However, studies show that there are around 2,445 unauthorized small waste fields throughout the country. Even though a general cleaning is conducted at unauthorized waste fields and around 70 percent of the waste is transported every spring and fall, people dump their wastes again. Around 1.8 million tons of wastes are generated at waste fields annually. This is an issue that needs to be tackled in Mongolia. You said that subprojects will be carried out to decrease open burning of wastes. Can you tell us more about them? We are planning to implement two projects. We will collect metal and plastic containers of oils and chemical substance	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19067
Poor outhouse management increases risk of infectious disease outbreak	By B.DULGUUN The public should stay alert of soil-borne diseases because the risks of flood and soil pollution is increasing as the weather becomes warmer, warns experts. Doctors say that a large number of people are infected with intestinal infectious diseases such as diarrhea and dysentery in early April as a result of floods, water contamination and soil pollution. They call this period “the infectious disease season”. Soil-related diseases are extremely harmful, particularly to the health of children. However, most people aren’t aware of its cause, consequences or ways to prevent it. Government agencies conduct research and study on this issue, but the public still remains ignorant as they are not being informed about the findings. The General Agency of Specialized Inspection, Mongolian Academy of Science’s Institute of Geography and Public Health Institute, and others have already studied soil pollution. The study shows that the main cause of soil pollution are the increasing number of vehicles, expansion of automobile markets, engine oil trading, industrial waste, and outhouses that do not meet standards in ger areas. According to a study conducted two years ago, merely 18 percent of the total area in Ulaanbaatar hadn’t been polluted. Researchers haven’t determined impacts of this change. Test results show that bacteria, fungus and mold were detected from 87.9 percent of total collected soil samples. As mentioned before, outhouses are one of the biggest causes of all types of intestinal infectious diseases. Reportedly, over 60 percent of total residents in the capital live in ger areas and more than 300 families consisting of some 180,000 people use outhouses. This means that 90 percent of families in ger area have a regular pit latrine. In other words, the majority of Ulaanbaatar residents living in ger areas still use pit latrines. However, most of these families can’t afford to regularly disinfect, sterilize and clean out their outhouses. Every substance inside pit latrines are absorbed into the soil, which impacts greatly on drinking water. It can be said that poor management of outhouses is one of the leading causes of various diseases young children get infected with in spring. In 2014, there were 1,704 reports of five types of intestinal infectious diseases, including hepatitis A, dysentery, salmonella infections and diarrheal diseases, in Mongolia. This is 394 more than the previous year. Around 71.3 percent of these diseases were dysentery and 1.6 percent were diarrheal diseases. Head of the Toxicology and Environmental Health Center of the Public Health Institute A.Enkhjargal was asked about the standard of outhouses in Mongolia. She said, “Outhouses, which are built for sanitary reasons, must have a ventilation and a seat or steps and must be built with sturdy materials that can be cleaned. It must have a light. It should be located near the home, but not where there’s a lot of wind or water. Outhouses need to be built on slightly higher ground to prevent precipitation from going into the pit latrine. In particular, it should be at least 15 meters away from their home and kitchen.” She advised cleaning the floor of outhouses with water or ash every day, leaving toilet seats uncovered, and checking the fly net every day to improve the hygiene of the outhouse. However, most families in ger areas have outhouses 10 within meters from their home. According to a research, eight out of 10 families in ger areas said that their outhouses don’t meet health and sanitary requirements and expressed their interest to change it. It was determined that seven out of 10 families don’t have lights in their outhouse and that it stinks and has flies swarming about. As soil pollution is increasing and causing various diseases, Head of the Early Warning and Response Unit of the National Research Center for Infectious Diseases N.Suvdmaa was asked about the current situation of intestinal infectious diseases in Ulaanbaatar. “Intestin	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19169
Corruption investigation of MP Kh.Battulga erupts in controversy	By M.OYUNGEREL The Independent Authority Against Corruption (IAAC) and the Division against Economic Crimes at the Criminal Police Department is investigating MP Kh.Battulga on suspicions of organized money laundering, and conducted a five-hour search at the offices of two of his companies at Bayangol Hotel Office building, where news outlets, MPs, celebrity athletes, and others gathered outside the building in protest against the investigation. The IAAC and police officers conducted searches at the offices of Tumen Khishgten, a company founded to build a Chinggis Khan monument and tourist destination, and Bayalgiin Khuvi, an infrastructure investment company. News.mn reported that MP Kh.Battulga was with MPs L.Erdenechimeg and D.Ganbat and journalist L.Munkhbayasgalan when police officers entered his office at approximately 3:00 p.m. MP L.Erdenechimeg said that Kh.Battulga’s assistant had been arrested the previous morning, on April 10. Five armed special police officers began guarding the Bayangol Hotel Office entrance at approximately 4:00 p.m. and oversaw entry and exit. The special police force allegedly demanded that the companies’ employees turn their phones off to cut off outside communication concerning the investigation. MPs J.Batzandan, B.Garamgaibaatar, G.Uyanga, and M.Zorigt were joined by Mayor E.Bat-Uul outside of the building, saying they saw news of the investigation on social media. While journalists and cameras not already in the building were not permitted inside, many news outlets quickly gathered outside the entrance to report on developments in the story and reports were being broadcast live on television and online. MP J.Batzandan said, “The police investigation is getting out of hand. I have information that they’re conducting an illegal investigation. All investigations must abide by the law. I came here to see the investigation process.” MP B.Garamgaibaatar said there was nothing else they could do except watch the investigation being carried out. “The arrival of Members of Parliament doesn’t create an advantage. We can’t make any statements now because we don’t know what’s going on,” said B.Garamgaibaatar. Mayor E.Bat-Uul tried to enter the building but was denied access. After leaving the building at 4:56 p.m., Advisor to the Speaker of the Parliament on Mortgage and Construction Affairs and General Secretary of the Mongolian Democratic Union G.Baigalmaa said she believed the investigative procedures were directly related to the election. “This might even be related to disabling the MP’s right to run for office,” G.Baigalmaa said. Rumors spread that Mongolian Democratic Union members were going to be arrested in connection to a case involving the alleged misappropriation of funds for the construction of new railway. MP G.Baigalmaa drew a connection to the arrest of MP Kh.Battulga’s former assistant, G.Tuvshinjargal. “This is all for political purposes. You can see, investigate, and check whether we laundered the money; everything’s open in the media. You all saw Tuvshinjargal getting arrested. She was held in custody for 13 days but was released without being interrogated once. If we had really committed a crime, there was enough time to come up with evidence,” said G.Baigalmaa. Kh.Battulga’s daughter B.Namuun said, “We’re just really living in a society where the law is no longer the law. They said they were only going to conduct a search. Then, what a big car they brought. Everyone who has opened their mouths about Oyu Tolgoi is being pressured. The reason behind all this is obvious. It’s probably methods to make him not participate in the election.” People who introduced themselves as the first members of the Mongolian Democratic Union, as well as athletes led by Mongolian Judo Association coach O.Baljinnyam and Olympic judo medalist N.Tuvshinbayar, gathered outside the Bayangol Hotel Office. Judoka Kh.Tsagaanbaatar said the athletes were afraid for sports officials who were in the building and	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19235
ASU celebrates 10 years of international education in 2016	By Michelle Borok American School of Ulaanbaatar (ASU) opened in Zaisan in 2006, and is preparing to celebrate its 10th anniversary this Fall. The private international school has grown rapidly in the past ten years and ASU’s student body has grown along with the school’s achievements. ASU offers its pre-kindergarten through 12th grade students a Western curriculum taught by certified Mongolian and foreign faculty members. ASU has been accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, and a large percentage of its graduates go on to pursue university educations abroad. The school is preparing for its annual Open House being held on Saturday, April 30, from 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Parents, friends and family of current and prospective students are invited to attend to meet ASU faculty, staff, and students. The UB Post spoke to some of ASU’s administrators and faculty to learn more about the school, what it has accomplished in the past ten years, and its hopes for the next ten years of molding Mongolia’s future leaders. Dr. Kate Sutton Jones, Secondary School Principal Parents have a lot of choices for private education in UB. What sets ASU apart? ASU was conceived and built by Mongolians to provide a Western education for Mongolians who seek to complete their post secondary education abroad and then return home with the aptitude and skills to contribute positively to the development of this country. This is why we refer to our students as Future Leaders. Our commitment is to provide the very best education to our Mongolian school population. ASU students participate in competitions and events abroad, and a large number of graduates go on to study at foreign universities. How does ASU prepare them for these academic challenges? We deliver a North American curriculum similar to those being delivered in comparable schools in Canada and America. To ensure our students are able to be successful, we provide the personalized support required for our English language learners to achieve the level of which they are capable. We set and maintain high academic standards through the recruitment and retention of the best teachers from abroad. We insist on high academic achievement, and our standards for a strong GPA are on par with the best schools in North America. What is ASU’s vision for the next ten years? To continue to develop the future leaders of Mongolia. To continue to educate graduates who not only perform at the highest level academically, but who also demonstrate the 21st century learning characteristics of creativity and innovation, communication, critical thinking and problem solving, collaboration, concern for the environment, and who are tech savvy digital natives. Roger Dutcher, Elementary School Principal As ASU approaches its 10th anniversary, what are some of the school’s most notable achievements over the past decade? One of our major milestones was when we opened our new Elementary School building in August 2013 for students from pre-kindergarten through grade 5 to meet the needs of an increasing student population. Enrollment at the Elementary School increased by more than 20 percent the following school year and we continue to grow. We have had a number of significant events over the years, including our initial accreditation in 2011 and our re-accreditation in 2014. In 2013, ASU was accepted into the prestigious National Honors Society, an organization that focuses on scholarship, service, leadership, and character. This year, ASU established the first Mongolian chapter of the National Art Honor Society. Also this year, several of our high school students participated in the Harvard Model United Nations event in Beijing, and three of our students received awards, one as an Outstanding Delegate. During the 2014-2015 school year, Advanced Placement courses in calculus, world history, and English were added. Over the years, our students have earned medals and certificates of distinction in several math co	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19293
Mongolian national movement demands cancellation of exploration licenses near Tuul River	Trans. by B.DULGUUN Although the public doesn’t take action every day, most are aware that clean water access and the quality of water have become pressing issues in Mongolia, as well as the rest of the world. However, neglect seems to have brought Tuul River, the main source of water for residents of the capital, on the verge of drying up. A couple of days ago, general coordinator of Save Our Queen Tuul River National Movement B.Jangar submitted a letter demanding the government and Parliament to pay attention to Tuul River and cancel licenses enabling mineral exploration alongside the river, as it has reportedly dried up in several areas extending to up to three kilometers. Activists claim that industrial waste from factories built up alongside the river played a major role in the drop of water levels and even caused the drying up in some areas. Since 2005, the Mineral Resources Authority of Mongolia issued 64 mining licenses to companies. Exploration projects along Tuul River has caused a total of 20 to 30 kilometers of the river to dry up, according to Save Our Queen Tuul River National Movement. The movement also demanded Parliament to discuss the current state of Tuul River at the regular meeting this Friday, April 22. “All river beds of Tuul River near Zaisan and Ikh Tengeriin Am Valley have been distributed to companies. Why are private companies owning public property? Companies aren’t just staying there. They’re cutting the few willows nearby and constructing buildings, causing Tuul River to dry up in some areas. The reason the law specified companies to not operate within 200 meters of river basins is because water supply is located beneath that radius. All of that has been destroyed and now, Tuul River is drying up in some areas,” stated B.Jangar. The Law on Prohibiting Mineral Exploration and Extraction Near Water Sources, Protected Areas and Forests, commonly referred as the long-named law, specifies the protection of bodies of water by means of so-called safety zones, which stretch from 50 to 200 meters from riverbanks. “Normal safety zones will cover no less than 200 meters from a body of water and health zones will cover no less than 100 meters of area from water sources,” states in the long-named law. According to the Ulaanbaatar Department of Environment and Green Development, a total of 203 exploration licenses have been issued near Tuul River basins across the capital. Head of the department Kh.Marat said that not a single company was licensed to explore or mine in Tuul River safety zones. He explained that the drying up of Tuul River is related to the increasing water consumption of residents of the capital. Reportedly, Ulaanbaatar residents’ water supply is drawn from five sources connected to Tuul River. “We didn’t issue 50 illegal licenses. Exploration licenses were granted for 39 areas following the Ulaanbaatar Mayor’s order and in accordance with the long-named law approved in 2014. At the moment, these areas haven’t been approved for use and are proceeding at construction stages. Operations that might harm the environment haven’t been carried out in these areas,” says Kh.Marat. “The companies are exploring within the basin, not in safety zones. They are all located 200 meters outside of bodies of water. There isn’t a company exploring within 200 meters.” On the other hand, Save Our Queen Tuul River National Movement claimed that industrial waste and factories being built within 50 meters of the river’s banks are causing the drying of the river. B.Jangar said that areas 50 meters from Tuul River are safety zones during floods. The movement demands immediate cancellation of construction, quarry, and pit approvals and licenses, which are reportedly causing Tuul River to dry up. The movement also wants to relocate buildings and factories near Tuul River. Earlier in March, B.Jangar sent an open letter to President Ts.Elbegdorj requesting him to review Tuul River and discuss issues concerning Tuul River 	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19362
Demonstrators demand resignation of Speaker of Parliament	By M.OYUNGEREL Mongoloo Avarya (Let’s Save Mongolia) Movement demonstrated outside the Parliament House on April 4. The movement said that they want answers to the demands they submitted to state administrators on March 30. Over 100 young people with red flags and ribbons, accompanied by senior citizens, demonstrated under the motto “We’re the ones who have to save Mongolia”, and marched from the Victory Square to the Parliament House. The movement demanded answers to three questions: “How much debt does each Mongolian citizen have?”, “When will the public get out of poverty?”, and “When will we live like people in our home country?” Head of the Let’s Save Mongolia Movement B.Gankhuyag said that they are demonstrating as they haven’t received a response to their questions, and demanded the Speaker of the Parliament to resign for ethical reasons. The demonstrators also submitted three more questions: “How much debt have you plunged your future into?”, “How many years does it take for wealthy Mongolia to come out of poverty?”, and “When will the citizens of Mongolia live in ownership of their home country?” The movement said they surveyed approximately 6,000 Mongolians, and 78.8 percent of them replied that they don’t believe in Mongolia’s future. “We’re in this condition where there’s a need for the public to move. Just now, they were about to bury nuclear waste in our country. We have to fight,” said one of the demonstrators. Later that day, Secretary General of the Parliamentary Office Amarjargal spoke with the demonstrators. “I received your demand. The document demands the Speaker of the Parliament Z.Enkhbold to be ethical, realize his responsibility, and resign. You will receive a reply to your demands on April 11.”	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19130
Wall panel fall off of night market and breaks car windshield and mirror	By M.OYUNGEREL Wall panel fell of the Night Market’s facade and landed on a Nissan El Grand parked below during a light snow storm on April 6, causing damage to its front and rear windshields and mirrors. D.Khosbayar, sales manager of Nar-Mon LLC which built the Night Market, said that the wall panels fell off due to a snow storm in the afternoon. “New traders place their advertisement and addresses on the market’s facade. This leads the facade’s mud and construction foam to detach from the building. Some of the traders use drills from inside, which also contributes to the detachment. The detached parts seemed to have fallen off during strong wind. We always run ordinary repairs. We were preparing to do another reparation at the end of April. “The wall panels fell on the car of a man who was conducting trade without permit on the market’s property. The man does not rent at the market. They called police officers themselves. Security guards are working on the site. Out of the 700 people our company provide jobs to, 300 of them are renters,” said D.Khosbayar. The owner of the car was identified to be A.Suvd, who allegedly ignored multiple demands by the Ulaanbaatar Emergency Management Agency and Ulaanbaatar Agency for Specialized Inspection to cease unpermitted trade in the public space outside the Night Market. “We used to pay a 150,000 MNT rent every month to Nar-Mon LLC administrators. But, why should private companies receive rent from people selling things in a public space,” said A.Suvd.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19161

New School No.11 opens	By M.OYUNGEREL Secondary School No.11 held the official opening of its new building in Sukhbaatar District on April 11. The school started its operation in the new building on April 4. The three-floor school building can accommodate approximately 350 students, according to school staff. It was built through a 3.4 billion MNT funding from the state budget within one year. Ulaanbaatar Mayor E.Bat-Uul, Head of the Ulaanbaatar Education Department Ts.Otgonbagana, Head of the Ulaanbaatar City Council B.Gan-Erdene, Sukhbaatar District Mayor D.Badarsuren and the school’s staff and students participated in the opening ceremony. School No.11 is a physics-and-mathematics specialized school with 400 students. Principal D.Enkhjargal underlined the school’s achievements during the opening ceremony. “In previous years, our students have participated in many Olympiads and competitions in the district, city and state level, and have succeeded. They also win first places in General Entrance Exams and we have gathered over 20 medals from international mathematics and physics Olympiads. Students D.Batzorig and B.Erdenebayar have won silver and bronze medals from the 54th and 55th International Mathematical Olympiads for two consecutive years,” said D.Enkhjargal. She expressed her gratitude to the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, and the capital and district administrators. The school was first built in 1947 as a one-floor elementary school. It expanded to a general education school in 1952. The school building was demolished in 2013 as it was considered a risky environment for children to study in. The General Agency for Specialized Investigation ordered the school to stop operations in 2010 and the school building was demolished in the spring of 2013. The 3.4 billion MNT for the new building was allocated in the state budget of 2014. The construction started on April 20, 2015. The school conducted operations in different buildings for the last three years. Recently, the school staff were sharing a building with General Education School No.31 in the morning and afternoon shifts. The opening of the new building allows secondary and high school children to go to class in one shift. The Ministry of Education, Culture and Science reported that since a year was enough to build a three-floor building for 350 students, Schools No.73, 38, 32, and 14, which are in the list of buildings at risk, can be rebuilt by 2017 if financial issues are resolved soon. The old buildings are expected be demolished and rebuilt through concession agreements this spring.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19241
Former heads of AFCCP clash over revoked fines	By M.OYUNGEREL Former heads of the Authority for Fair Competition and Consumer Protection (AFCCP) O.Magnai and T.Ayursaikhan have started an argument concerning revoked fines. O.Magnai resign from the job in December 2014 to T.Ayursaikhan, who also gave the job a year later in December 2015. Last week, T.Ayursaikhan said in an interview with local media that O.Magnai imposed fines and then revoked them soon after signing agreements with companies. In response to the the interview, O.Magnai held a press conference on Monday and claimed that T.Ayursaikhan was the one who revoked big fines and took an example on NIK LLC’s fine. O.Magnai said that he will sue T.Ayursaikhan for defamation. On Wednesday, T.Ayursaikhan held a press conference and presented evidence that allegedly supports that NIK LLC was fined and that he didn’t defame O.Magnai. T.Ayursaikhan claimed that O.Magnai imposes fines and revokes them after making agreements with companies. “When O.Magnai was the Head of the AFCCP, he imposed large amounts of fines on home owners’ associations and other retail chains on the basis that they violated consumer rights and interests. He soon revoked them before a hearing and made an agreement,” he said. During his press conference on Wednesday, he said that he will “take full responsibility for his words” because they’re all facts. T.Ayursaikhan then showed documents where O.Magnai had imposed 268 million MNT in fines on MIAT and Genco Tour companies, 10 million MNT on Tsolmon Us Company, and certain amounts on other companies, including Khatan Suljee and Buyan LLC. O.Magnai clarified on the issue. “There were three big retail chains at the time. They were all imposed a fine for the same reason. During the hearing, all of them notified to resolve the violations and signed a settlement agreement that ordered the three stores to pay the fines without any dispute should the situation repeats itself,” said O.Magnai. Last Monday, O.Magnai said during a press conference, “In 2012, NIK LLC was imposed a fine of 4.9 billion MNT for creating dearth of fuel without a basis. The AFCCP won in three court sessions, but the court ruled to reevaluate the fine amount based on price evaluations of A-92 and diesel fuels. I personally didn’t want to resolve an issue involving huge amounts of money alone, and created a workgroup consisting of five people. I gave my position before the issue was resolved,” he said. O.Magnai claimed that after T.Ayursaikhan took office, he withdrew NIK LLC’s status as a monopoly, which led the fine to be revoked, and that he illegally fired his workgroup in charge of the issue. “T.Ayursaikhan is defaming me,” said O.Magnai. On April 13, T.Ayursaikhan said that O.Magnai’s statement on Monday was false. “Before I start the conference, let me make something clear. My interview was published just recently. Why is it that an interview I gave when I was the Head of the AFCCP published just now?”he asked. He added that he wasn’t trying to defame O.Magnai in relation to the election. “Inspector J.Ochirkhuyag said he hadn’t received estimation information again when I took this position. But J.Ochirkhuyag had received the fine information, and had the estimation already. It was found during investigation that he had hidden the facts. By law, court decisions should be implemented from the day it is ruled. It is proven by this that officials led by O.Magnai slowed this process down on purpose,” T.Ayursaikhan added. According to T.Ayursaikhan, NIK LLC submitted a request to revoke the fine but he refused, and transferred it to the Independent Authority Against Corruption on December 16, 2015. He said that NIK LLC paid their fines and showed a document related to the fine. “The original document was lost from the AFCCP. Since it couldn’t be found, we decided to fine them as stated in the law. According to Article 27.2 of the Law on Competition, a company is to be imposed a fine of up to five percent of the enterprise owner’s ne	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19276
Health officials report 59 children have died from measles in 2016	By M.OYUNGEREL Representatives from the Ministry of Health and Sports, the National Center for Communicable Diseases, and the National Center for Maternal and Children’s Health of Mongolia, led by the Ministry’s State Secretary S.Lambaa, held a press conference on April 15, stating that 59 children have died from measles in 2016, not 918 as reported on social media. At the beginning of the press conference, S.Lambaa said, “In the last few years, child mortality has decreased through the Mongolian government’s sustainable policy. For instance, the mortality rate of children under five was at 87.5 percent in every 1,000 births. In 2010, the number decreased to 20 percent, and to 18.3 percent in 2015. We have completed the Millennium Development Goal to decrease the mortality of children under five by four times. With this number, Mongolia has been listed as one of nine countries to have successfully implemented the UN’s Millennium Development Goals.” He added that the mortality of children under one was at 63.4 percent in 1990, and has decreased to 15.3 percent as of 2015. Deputy Minister Ts.Oyunbaatar said that 491 children under five died in the first three months of 2016. He said the information that 918 children under five have died from measles is inaccurate. “In the first three months of 2016, 491 children under the age of five have died, 427 of which were children under one. Child mortality has increased by 120 compared to last year,” he said. Of the total number of children who have died from measles, 76.2 percent were zero to eight months old and had not been vaccinated; 70 percent were children diagnosed with comorbidity due to the presence of chronic diseases, rachitis (commonly known as rickets), malnutrition, anemia, immune system disorders, and leukemia; 96.8 percent had pneumonia at the time they contracted measles; and 3.2 percent had laryngitis. Prime Minister Ch.Saikhanbileg and S.Lambaa visited the National Center for Communicable Diseases (NCCD) on April 15 and met with health sector administrators, doctors from emergency and intensive care units, and the parents of children being hospitalized. Currently, 18 people are being treated in the intensive care unit at the NCCD. Two months ago 350 million MNT was spent from government aid funds to purchase hospital equipment for the NCCD. The equipment, including one incubator, 12 monitors, four medical ventilators, 12 automated syringes, 13 automated intravenous pumps, and a defibrillator, arrived on April 14 and is now being installed in the intensive care unit. NCCD administrators said the new equipment will solve the equipment shortage problem. “We ordered the equipment to reach medical care standards, such as providing one ventilator for every 10 beds,” said S.Lambaa. The parents of children being hospitalized at the NCCD stressed that there were not enough doctors and nurses at the center. “Nurses from intensive care units at other hospitals can’t work at ours, as they’re not specially trained, but we have increased the number of our staff. Currently, 45 to 50 nurses are working the night shift, compared to the 25 who normally work the night shift. “Giving the staff’s overtime payments around October leads to a lot of complaints, but we have started giving the overtime payments on time, which increases the staff’s enthusiasm and motivation,” said the Head of the National Center for Communicable Diseases, D.Nyamkhuu. He added that the center has opened a lounge for the patient caretakers upon request. Prime Minister Ch.Saikhanbileg ordered the Ministry of Health and Sports and Ulaanbaatar and province administrators to offer at-home medical examinations for children eight months old and younger until July 1. “It’s right to tell the children’s parents to keep their children at home, as doctors will examine them by visiting their homes,” said Ch.Saikhanbileg. The PM encouraged state and private organizations to permit paid leave to staff with children under one 	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19321
Parents hold fundraising in response to the measles outbreak	By M.OYUNGEREL Parents gathered in front of the Buddha monument in Zaisan on April 16 to raise public awareness about the measles outbreak and to collect donations to support families with children currently hospitalized. Members of a group for Mongolian mothers on Facebook organized the event, bringing boitog, traditional felt shoes for children, to represent the children who have contracted the highly contagious disease. The group’s members encouraged parents to bring diapers, food, and other helpful items for distribution to the parents of children being hospitalized for measles. According to the group’s members, one child had died of complications from measles Saturday evening, adding to the reported 59 children who have died from measles since the beginning of 2016. Some parents who lost children to measles attended the event. They implored politicians and policymakers to pay attention to addressing the measles outbreak rather than politics and the election. The caretakers of several children being hospitalized at the National Center for Communicable Diseases stressed that there was a shortage of medical equipment and talked about the difficult conditions being faced by the hospitalized children. “My child was diagnosed with measles within a week after being vaccinated. It’s time the ministry inspects the vaccines being injected into children’s bodies,” said one parent. Singer and parliamentary candidate M.Narantuya took part in the event and met with some parents of children being hospitalized at the National Center for Communicable Diseases to draw public attention to what she said is an issue that “shouldn’t be neglected”.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19327
PM issues decree to resolve measles outbreak	By M.OYUNGEREL On April 20, Prime Minister Ch.Saikhanbileg issued a decree to resolve issues related to the measles outbreak and to stop the spread and contamination of the disease that has killed 59 children in the last three months. The PM ordered Deputy Prime Minister and acting Health and Sports Minister Ts.Oyunbaatar to create an emergency workgroup under the State Emergency Commission to evaluate the conditions of measles outbreak throughout the nation and to organize activities to prevent spread. Prime Minister Ch.Saikhanbileg ordered all district and province mayors to manage scheduled or requested at-home medical examinations by family clinic doctors and provide vaccination every Saturday for children under one years of age until July 1. The decree ordered employers to permit two hours of paid leave to female staff with infants until July 1 to enable parents to take care of their children and prevent their children from getting infected with measles. PM Ch.Saikhanbileg instructed Finance Minister B.Bolor and Ts.Oyunbaatar to allocate 982 million MNT from the state budget for decontamination, sanitization, fuel payments, and extra hour payments of hospital staff. He ordered State Secretary of the Minister of Health and Sports S.Lambaa to intensify financial, economic, and medical groups operating in response to measles. The working group was instructed to give weekly reports on the measles outbreak and effectiveness of prevention activities. Finance Minister B.Bolor and Minister of Population Development and Social Protection S.Erdene were assigned to discuss the allocation of 453.9 million MNT from the Health Insurance Fund for medication required to treat measles patients during the National Council of Social Insurance meeting.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19356
Ministry of Education grants 2.6 billion MNT to students	By M.OYUNGEREL The Ministry of Education, Culture and Science granted up to six million MNT to 450 projects developed by general education school students from 21 provinces and Ulaanbaatar. The grants amounted to 2.6 billion MNT in total and an award ceremony was held on April 19. The 450 projects from 427 schools, involving 500,000 students and teachers, were chosen from a project competition among students to promote their school program, which was organized by the ministry through their Education Quality Reform Project. During the award ceremony, Minister of Education, Culture and Science L.Gantumur said, “In this time where the core program is in progress, I’m confident that developing and implementing innovative projects that meet the school’s needs develops well-rounded students, improves cooperation between teachers and students, and contributes to the independence of general education schools.” The grant program will be implemented in three stages with inclusion of state owned general education schools. In the first stage in January, projects of 200 schools were chosen and they are already being implemented. In the second stage, projects of 427 schools were chosen to receive the grants. The ministry initiated the Education Quality Reform Project in 2012 to improve elementary education quality and to promote the core education programs by strengthening the Mongolian language, natural sciences, and mathematics education quality. The Education Quality Reform Project is funded through a 60 billion MNT soft loan from the World Bank’s International Development Association. The project, in addition developing STEM education – science, technology, engineering, and mathematics – aims to have a positive impact on education by creating an education quality evaluation mechanism.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19403

Nisvanis to release fifth album later this year	Trans. by B.TUNGALAG On the occasion of the 20th anniversary of Nisvanis, the band celebrated the launch of their new album “Masturbation” on April 4 at Gandan Live House. The following is an interview with bandleader D.Enkh-Amgalan. Your new album’s title is very controversial. Why did you name it in this way? Actually, the album title is related to financial issues. I decided to name the album “Setgel Khudulnu” (Excitement). A friend of mine, who financially supported our album, said that if we named the album like that he wouldn’t support us. He said “Setgel Khudulnu” is a boring name. So we decided to name it “Masturbation”. You have released four albums in 20 years. What is special about your new album? Our band tried to be different and unique from other bands when we were first established. We criticized social issues through our songs “Emiin San Ruu Alkhsan Ni” (Walking to the Pharmacy) and “Surguuli Nuraasai” (Wish School Would Collapse) in our first album. We get satisfaction from our songs. Modernist poet B.Galsansukh wrote the songs in “Masturbation”. In addition, I don’t think that other bands can release an album named “Masturbation” except Nisvanis. We are happy that we sing about naughty and peculiar issues. Nisvanis made music videos for some songs in the new album. Will you make a music video for all the songs? We will make music videos for our other songs. We made a music video for “Masturbation”, “Tsag Khugatsaa Bugdiig Emchilne” (Time Heals Everything), and “Setgel Khudulnu” (Excitement). You can watch it on YouTube. We are planning to make a music video for “Aaban, Beeben”. Have your music videos been featured by TV stations? Yes. We don’t care if our music videos are or are not played. Rock music lovers and fans of Nisvanis are watching our new videos through the internet. We are not expecting our videos to be watched on TV. “Masturbation” was released 10 years after your third album. What are you planning to do in the future? Have you made plans for your next album? The name of our fifth album will be very strange. We already started writting songs for the fifth album. We will work on our fifth album after Nis Nis Fest 2016. The fifth album is expected to be released in September or October. We haven’t done anything in the past 10 years. That’s why we are planning to release two albums in one year. Our fifth album will be titled “Setgel Medreliin Uvchtun”(Mentally Ill Patient). Actually it was a secret. We are young people. So we have to create a very energetic album. After “Mental Illness”, we are planning to make more mature songs to suit our age. Poets work closely with artists and performer. Does it influence your songs? Of course it does. Me and poet B.Galsansukh are childhood friend. My friend Galsansukh is our spiritual mentor. Nisvanis is friends with lots of painters, poets and journalists. I am very happy that we create songs through their unique way of thinking. You usually write your own songs. Why? We agreed on one thing when we were first established. That was that I had to be responsible for songwriting because I am a singer. I usually don’t participate in music arrangement. The band’s view and philosophy are reflected in our songs. I am responsible for leading the band. I think I am carrying out my duty well. How do you choose other people who write songs for you? It is very difficult to make music on others’ work. Because that song might not match our band’s music genre and philosophy. So I choose poems of B.Galsansukh and B.Erdene-Solongo. I usually don’t use songs from other people. Your songs have controversial themes. Do you often receive criticism? Yes, we do. Some people say: What is this? Or is this a song? There must be criticism. We are also psychologically prepared for criticism. And we are very confident in what we do. For example, we received a lot of criticism for “Wish School Would Collapse”. At the time, yellow journalism had a strong influence. We faced many offensive c	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19140
Painter S.Munkbaatar wins 1st international watercolor biennale	By B.BAATAR Mongolian artist S.Munkhbaatar competed in the 1st International Watercolor Biennale, which was organized by the International Watercolor Society. Applications for the event was held in Vancouver, Canada. S.Munkhbaatar’s “Eagle” won first place in the 16 to 35 years of age category. The final result of the competition took place in Iran at the beginning of this month. Artist S.Munkhbaatar was born in 1984, in Uliastai, Zavkhan Province. He earned his bachelor’s degree in fine arts at the School of Fine Arts of the State University of Arts and Culture in 2005. Below is a brief interview with artist S.Munkhbaatar. How many artists participated in the competition? The rule of this competition was a little bit special. I submitted my artwork for the competition through the internet at the beginning of 2016. On April 3, the International Watercolor Society told me that I won. I submitted two works for the competition. My work “Eagle” won first place. That’s why I don’t know how many artists from how many countries competed. An exhibition of top artworks from the competition will be held. This competition took place in two categories: under 16 and 16 to 35 years of age. When did you paint “Eagle”? Why did you name that portrait “Eagle”? I painted it early in 2016. I tried to give my portrait subject the qualities of an eagle, such as their sharp sight and dignity. I also submitted an artwork for the competition running in Canada. The result of the first stage was released. I passed. The second stage result hasn’t been released yet.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19179

T.Munkhnasan: I had a feeling that I would win the competition	By B.BAATAR Mongolian hairdresser S.Munkhnasan of Vidal Salon competed in the 46th Organization Mondiale Coiffure (OMC) Hairworld competition, held in Seoul, South Korea, from March 27 to 29, and won the Golden Cup. The hairdresser has been working at Vidal Salon since 2005. Below is an interview with T.Munkhnasan. Mongolia has never achieved success like this before at international competitions for hairdressing. How do you feel? I am very happy. It is the result of my hard work and dream. Now I am a globally recognized hairdresser. I have to be more responsible. You competed against B.Altanshagai of Mongolia. Was it hard to compete against a teammate? Tell us about the competition. Of course it was hard. My colleague B.Altanshagai came in fourth place. Altanshagai is my teacher. We have been working together since 2006. He is my best friend. Over 1,000 hairdressers and make-up artists from 40 countries competed in this year’s competition. Twenty-nine Mongolian hairdressers, make-up artists, and 11 models took part in this year’s event. For me, I competed against over 50 hairdressers. It was an honor to compete with top international hairdressers. I am very happy that I chose to become a hairdresser. Which country’s hairdressers impressed you? In my category, hairdressers from Japan and Poland were very impressive. In my opinion, their aesthetic taste was higher than the others. Did you prepared well for the competition? I did my preparation very well in a very short time. I had a feeling that I would win the competition. Were you confident? We don’t participate in competitions to lose. Every participant wants to win. I have participated in the World Championship twice. I have experience. I participated in the World Championship in 2012 for the first time. I placed 16th. In 2014, I also competed in the World Championship and placed 10th. That’s why I was very close to winning. Tell us about the tasks you completed in the World Championship? I did three kinds of haircuts: classic, professional and decorative. Professional hairdressing is difficult. People who participated in the competition were interested in learning about the skills of Mongolian hairdressers. Where did you learn your craft? I took a hairdressing course after graduating general education school. I studied at a center named Abuka. Women’s hairstyling and New Year’s decorative hairstyles were masterpieces to me. At the time, I told myself “I have to become a hairdresser.” I have been working as a hairdresser for 14 years. What do you think about the hairstyle trends of this year? This year’s trend is soft and natural colors. Keeping your natural hair color is the best.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19253

Mongolian actor cast as Romeo in the USA	By B.BAATAR Mongolian actor G.Zanabazar, known as Zana Gankhuyag, scored the role of Romeo in “Romeo and Juliet” staged at Synetic Theater in Washington, D.C., USA last month. The following is an interview with Zana Gankhuyag by Unuudur. Please tell us about yourself to our readers. Why did you decide to become an actor? My name is Zanabazar Gankhuyag. I have been in the USA since 2002 with my family. My mother is an eye doctor, and my father is well-known artist N.Gankhuyag. He makes tsam dance masks and costumes. My father participates in art events to promote Mongolia, and he organizes tsam mask exhibitions. I used to study at a Mongolian school in Washington, D.C. every Saturday to not forget my mother tongue and culture. Dancer of the Mongolian State Academic Theater of Opera and Ballet Purevjav used to teach dance at my school. My father forced me to learn how to dance at first. But I fell in love with dancing and stage arts. After that dance class, students of the school participated in events held in France, Germany, Belgium and Sweden and promoted Mongolia. At that time, I decided to become an actor. Then I entered the theater class of the school. How did you enter Synetic Theater? Synetic Theater selected artists from local schools. I also trained in taekwondo and Mongolian traditional dance. I think that influenced me to become an actor at Synetic Theater. Initially, I played Mercutio in a “Romeo and Juliet” play staged by Synetic Theater. After that, the head of Synetic Theater called me and offered me a job. I didn’t believe it myself. I worked as a supporting actor for a year at Synetic Theater. I was studying in high school at the time. Synetic Theater gave me a wonderful opportunity. Do you have to try harder than other American artists at Synetic Theater because you are Asian? Every artist has to try hard. It is difficult to be selected as a protagonist. It doesn’t matter if you are Asian or of other ethnic background. On the other hand, art is a business. So the theater has to choose talented artists to attract audiences.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19418
Palestinian reconciliation: Positive, but security cooperation with Israel has costs	The Mark News By Steve Hibbard The Palestinian government that was sworn in on June 2, subsequent to the Fatah–Hamas unity agreement that was signed in April, represents a significant victory for President Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian Authority (PA). Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh’s Hamas government was disbanded, and the writ of the Palestinian Authority was extended, at least nominally, to Gaza. Endorsement of the new technocratic government, which contains no Hamas ministers, must have been painful for Hamas. Many of its senior figures, including Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah, do not differ from the PA administration it replaced. The unity government has pledged itself to three principles that were problematic for Hamas, but that the United States and European Union countries demanded as conditions for their aid: non-violence, adherence to past agreements, and recognition of Israel. Security cooperation with Israel, anathema to Hamas, will also continue. Several factors help explain why Hamas accepted such a humiliating agreement: years of hardship caused by Israeli economic sanctions; the loss of Iranian and Syrian support due to the civil war in Syria; and a backlash against a major financial supporter, Qatar, in the Arab world. But the major blow was the overthrow of Mohamed Morsi’s Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt, and the subsequent closing of border crossings between Egypt and Gaza, as well as the destruction of most smuggling tunnels under the border, which brought arms and other supplies into Gaza and revenue to the Haniyeh government. Acceptance of the three principles has proven sufficient to ensure EU and U.S. support for the PA unity government. Indeed, despite statements of caution intended to placate Israel and its supporters, policy makers have ample reason to welcome the waning of Hamas and the waxing of more moderate Palestinian factions – most notably Fatah – that are committed to a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Western interests could be well served by aid projects in the West Bank and Gaza designed to reward moderation. In theory, the unity government will last only until new elections in early 2015, which could – though it’s unlikely – bring Hamas to power. But slippage can be anticipated, as can delays caused by Israeli objection to East Jerusalem Palestinians voting. The Netanyahu government’s over-the-top reaction to Palestinian unity, such as its immediate announcement of new housing construction in illegal East Jerusalem and West Bank settlements, reflects visceral distaste for Hamas. But, given the Netanyahu government’s failure to work constructively with Abbas and other Palestinian leaders who are committed to a negotiated settlement, it seems fair to conclude that on the Israeli right, there is little enthusiasm for the enhanced international credibility that the unity government could bring to the Palestinian quest for an end to occupation and an equitable two-state solution to the conflict with Israel. Recent votes in the United Nations supportive of Palestinian statehood, as well as the growing strength of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign against Israel, demonstrate that worldviews on the conflict are evolving. The United States has been largely impervious to the BDS campaign, but on Friday, June 20, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) voted to divest its shares in Caterpillar, Motorola Solutions, and Hewlett-Packard on the grounds that they have been providing Israel with equipment used in the occupation of Palestinian territory. The decision took place despite vigorous opposition from major American Jewish organizations, and reflects, in part, the relative moderation the PA has displayed in recent years. If the unity government brings further moderation, these trends could accelerate. But building support internationally through moderation and security cooperation with Israel comes with costs for the PA. The abduction of three Israeli t	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=10255
Ukraine blames Russia for destroying evidence at MH17 crash site	By MARGAUX MAXWELL Ukraine has accused Russia of destroying evidence at the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, a claim which Mongolia’s neighboring country denies. The Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 exploded in Eastern Ukraine over an area controlled by pro-Russian separatists, killing all 289 passengers inside. While investigations are still underway, the United States government says they have evidence that a Russian-made missile was responsible for the blast. Ukraine has accused Rebels of entering the crash site and tampering with the corpses in order to cover up involvement in the crash. Most of the bodies are still lying over open country, inaccessible by international monitors such as Europe’s The Organization for Security and Cooperation who were barred from entering the area by gunmen, officials reported. The black boxes from the flight have been reportedly found but are currently in the hands of pro-Russian separatists. Families of the victims are furious and are demanding that their loved ones be brought home. “Twenty-three and 20 years old! They’re lying there on the floor somewhere. I don’t know where they are. I want to arrange their funeral. I can’t. I don’t know where they are. I want them back. I want my children back. Look at those people. How beautiful. They have to come back. Mr Putin – send my children home. Send them home. Please,” a Dutch mother told a UK based newspaper. Present Vladimir Putin responded to the allegations against Russia in a televised meeting Thursday, arguing that the crash would not have occurred if not for the civil war in Ukraine. The draw between Kremlin and Western powers have intensified, as the West is pushing hard for an credible investigation. The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, and the U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry, agreed that all evidence should be handed over for international investigation.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=10701
President’s chief of staff P.Tsagaan hands state flag to mountaineer B.Tseveendash	By B.TUNGALAG The President’s Chief of Staff P.Tsagaan received chairman of Healthy Mongolia Hiking Club, International Sports Master B.Teveendash, on Wednesday to hand him the state flag of Mongolia. Mountaineer B.Tseveendash left Mongolia on April 7 to climb Mount Everest for the third time. During the state flag handing ceremony, P.Tsagaan said, “I want to wish luck on your third voyage to climb the roof of the world, Mount Everest. I hope you can raise the Mongolian state flag on Mount Everest, and pray for all Mongolians’ fortune.” Mountaineer B.Tseveendash said, “The pride and fortune of every nation is kept in their state flag. For me, I am leaving for Mount Everest tomorrow (April 7) for the third time. I received the state flag from P.Tsagaan today, and I will not lose Mongolians’ trust.” B.Tseveendash first climbed Mount Everest in 2012. In 2015, he climbed Mount Everest with State Honored Athlete and International Sport Master for mountaineering T.Gurragchaa. His second ascent to Mount Everest was stopped due to a magnitude 7.9 earthquake in Nepal, which killed more than 7,000 people and injured 14,000 on April 25.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19175
Mongolia’s first metal festival to rock at UB Palace	Mongolia’s first ever international metal festival, Noise Metal Fest 2014, is taking place at UB Palace, Ulaanbaatar, on August 23. Mongolian metal bands Aysiin Salkhi, Nisvanis, Bulsara, Metronome, Motorway, Silent Scream, Aadar, Shugam, Purgatory and Destroyers will participate in the festival. Canadian band Mongol, which plays folk death metal, and Inner Mongolian band Nine Treasures, will take part in the festival. Two members of Mongol arrived in Mongolia on August 11. The following is a brief interview with members of Mongol, guitarist Thomas Quiring and solo guitarist Luke Barry. Have you ever visited Mongolia before? How do you feel? Luke: It’s my first visit to Mongolia. I like Mongolia. We received a very friendly welcome. I decided to come to Mongolia when we received an invitation to participate in Noise Metal Fest 2014. Thomas and I came here before the other members. We want to know about Mongolian culture. Thomas: The land of Mongolia is so vast. I am very happy that we came to the homeland of Chinggis Khaan. We hope we can make many good memories in Mongolia. What about the other members? When will they arrive? Thomas: Our band has six members; drummer Kenton Barry, keyboardist Dayton Barry, bass guitarist Josh Blackburn and singer Brandon Knott. Luke: They will come here on August 15. Did you guys travel around the countryside? Luke: We haven’t gone to the countryside yet. We went to Chinggis Square, Bogd Khaan Palace Museum and the National Garden Park. Thomas: Yesterday we went to Urgoo Cinema and watched a film. We are planning to go to the countryside after the other members arrive. Why did you name your band Mongol? Luke: Our band was established in 2009, but with a different name. We have been playing folk death metal since 2010. Then we changed the name of our band. We chose Mongol after thinking for a long time. We know about the history and conquests of Chinggis Khaan. We know about his empire. That is why we named ourselves Mongol. How many albums have you released so far? Luke: Our band has two albums currently. Our first album was released in 2012 and it was titled “The Altan Urag”. Our second album was released this year with the name “Chosen by Tengri”. How did you learn about Noise Metal Fest 2014? Thomas: I heard that this kind of festival hasn’t been organized here. The organizers of the festival decided to invite bands from abroad and contacted us. We accepted the invitation. Why did you choose to play rock? Thomas: Such a hard question. It is very hard to explain. Just fell in love with it. Luke: It’s very nice to show people what I can do, and I think live music, especially rock music, can express emotions. Will you visit Mongolia again? Luke: Maybe. We are interested in Playtime Festival. If we have a chance to participate in Playtime, we will come back here.

Security ramped up for Chinese President’s visit	Mongolian security officials began ramping up security across Ulaanbaatar on Monday with the impending visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping. In a press release, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the Chinese President was due to discuss bilateral matters on Thursday. However the UB Post could not confirm rumors prior to deadline that the Chinese President’s visit is set to begin a day earlier than both Mongolian and Chinese officials had announced. However, major multi-use venues Blue Sky and Monnis Towers confirmed that they were advised by police not to open windows facing the State Palace on August 20 and 21. Sources in the Chingeltei District Police Department confirmed that security has been heightened since Monday. He noted that during high level official visits, the police typically heighten security on the day of the visit, and that the police are taking on more work during this particular visit. Mongolia and China enjoy an officially diplomatic if complicated historical relationship, further complicated by anti-Chinese sentiment common in some sectors of Mongolia society and politics. With increased trade, boosted after the free market and democratic revolution of 1989, Mongolia’s dependence on China for consumer goods jumped radically, which some see as cause for concern for Mongolian national security and independence. China’s state-sponsored People’s Daily describes the relationship between the two countries as one of “constant progress” since the revised signing of the Treaty on Friendly Relations and Cooperation in 1994. President Ts.Elbegdorj has been particularly keen on reshaping the image of Mongolia’s southern neighbor to the public, for which he has received both criticism and praise. Bilateral relations have improved as the nations increased high level dialogues in recent months. President Ts.Elbegdorj visited China in May for a regional security summit, which was followed by visits from Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in June, and Vice-President Li Yuanchao in April. The last visit of a Chinese president to Mongolia occurred eleven years ago in 2003, with the visit of then President Hu Jintao. During the visit, officials are expected to draw up a series of energy and infrastructure deals, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The deals will cover the construction of two coal-to-gas plants that will supply up to 95 percent of its output to China. Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Jianchao told the South China Morning Post that the two countries would also sign deals on coal mining and infrastructure. The UB Post will provide coverage of President Xi Jinping’s visit in our next edition. By Khash-Erdene	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=11456
The Mongolian public grieves for France	By M.OYUNGEREL Following the terrorist attacks in Paris, the Mongolian public, from the President to average citizens, have been sharing their grief and sending condolences to the French community in Mongolia and abroad after the series of attacks in Paris on the night of November 13. On November 14, President of Mongolia Ts.Elbegdorj expressed his deepest condolences to the President of France, Francois Hollande. His letter read, “Dear Francois Hollande, the President of France, I express my deepest condolences to you and the friends and families of the victims of the terrorist attacks in Paris on behalf of the people of Mongolia and in my own name. Mongolians are sharing your grief for the recent horrendous atrocity.” The Prime Minister also tweeted his condolences on behalf of all Cabinet members. The Mongolian Twitter community was in chaos when the news broke in Mongolia on the morning of November 14, with some who reported having lost their French friends. The Mayor’s Office workers and the Mongolian public expressed their condolences, placing flowers and lighting candles outside the French Embassy in Mongolia on November 15. They went into the embassy and signed condolences cards as well. Many Mongolian Facebook users have imposed the French flag over their profile pictures and have posted about anti-terrorism sentiments. Terrorists attacked six parts of Paris at four restaurants, Stade de France stadium, and Bataclan Concert Hall. Three teams of gunmen and suicide bombers killed at least 129 civilians and over 350 people were injured, 99 of whom are in critical condition. The attacks have been identified as the deadliest in Europe since the 2004 Madrid bombings. The group Islamic State (IS) has claimed responsibility for the attack. The IS said it was retaliation for French military action in Syria and Iraq. Investigators believe that a multinational team committed the attacks. The team reportedly had links to the Middle East, Belgium, Germany, and possible roots in France. The first attacker to be identified was a French national. Identification cards on the bodies of the attackers shot at Bataclan revealed Syrian and Egyptian citizenship. A state of emergency has been declared by the President and border controls have been tightened. The President of France said in a speech given in immediate response to the attacks, “To all those who have seen these awful things, I want to say we are going to lead a war which will be pitiless.”	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=16884
Asia Pacific: Response to Climate Change	By Dr. Shamshad Akhtar Global leaders are gathered in Paris for the COP21 climate summit. Given Asia Pacific’s size and its contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions, its voice and commitment are critical to achieving a comprehensive agreement on climate change. Many Asia Pacific countries are developing and must focus on achieving sustained economic growth and development. Of the 49 regional members of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, 43 have a light climate footprint, contributing only 10 percent to global emissions. For these countries, notably the least developed countries, Pacific islands and low-lying states, vulnerability to climate-related natural disasters will grow with climate change. At the other extreme, the region is home to six of the top 10 emitters in the world – China, India, Russia, Japan, Indonesia, and Iran – which account for about 43 percent of global emissions. Of these top six Asian emitters, fossil fuel-based energy is responsible for about 80 percent of their collective emissions, with emissions from industrial processes, agriculture, and waste playing a lesser role. Mitigating the emissions of these countries requires multiple actions, key among which is a switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. Of the 183 countries that have submitted Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 43 are from the Asia Pacific region. Countries across the region have indicated both conditional and unconditional reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. These include economy-wide emissions targets or deviation from a business as usual (BAU) scenario to intensifying targets for emissions per unit of GDP. Many INDCs, particularly those from the developing countries, include an overall rise in emissions by 2030. While this is remarkable in its own right, it still leaves a significant gap between the INDCs pledged and the cuts required to keep the temperature increase to below a two degrees Celsius warming limit. This gap is close to 16 billion tons of CO2 reductions per annum by 2030, roughly equal to the current emissions of China, India, and Russia combined. The only way we can bridge this gap is if we collectively treat the INDCs announced as the floor to be raised by enabling countries to adopt and implement additional measures needed with technical, financial, and capacity support. Despite the present gap between the INDCs and the necessary emission reductions, progress is underway in our region. This not only sets specific economies on course for a low carbon future, but will also alter the global dynamics. China’s INDC, for instance, targets emissions to peak by 2030 at the latest, and for emissions intensity of GDP to decline by 60 to 65 percent. Progress in energy efficiency, switching to gas and the development of hydro, wind, and solar energy has now begun to show results, with China’s coal consumption having peaked in 2013. India proposes to reduce emissions per unit of GDP by 33 to 35 percent, and to ensure that 40 percent of its power generation capacity is from non-fossil sources by 2030. In support of this objective, India plans to install 60 gigawatts of wind power and 100 gigawatts of solar power capacity by 2022, a six-fold increase over the current capacity. Changes in the energy generation mix, efficiency and conservation of energy use, and developing carbon sinks through reforestation and soil carbon will be important strategies to stabilize emissions in the Asia Pacific region. There has been some progress on all these fronts in our region, but more needs to be done. With advanced energy efficiency, the region could save 35 percent of its energy consumption against business as usual by 2035. As the region’s urban population is expected to reach 3.2 billion by 2050, there is an opportunity to pioneer low-carbon cities with energy efficient buildings, innovative urban pla	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=17326
The End of Poverty?	The Mark News By Thomas Pogge As United Nations officials struggle to define the development priorities of the next 15 years, the UN Millennium Campaign, the World Bank, and many other organs of the development industry tell us that we are nearing the end of poverty. Yet, well over half of human beings are still suffering serious deprivations of poverty, such as child labor, chronic undernourishment, illiteracy, and lack of access to safe drinking water, shelter, sanitation, electricity, and essential medicines. In some ways, conditions among humanity’s poorer half have improved over the last 25 years. But the trend depends heavily on the definitions and methods used for measurement. The UN Food and Agricultural Organization recently transformed a steadily rising undernourishment trend into a steadily falling one by introducing an “improved methodology” that counts as undernourished only those whose caloric intake is “inadequate to cover even minimum needs for a sedentary lifestyle” for “over a year.” This definition excludes those who suffer other nutritional deficits (vitamins, proteins, minerals) and those who are not adequately nourished by the sedentary diet because they must do serious physical work in their home or for a living. The World Bank similarly improved the extreme poverty trend by lowering its international poverty line from $1 per person per day in 1985 dollars to a grotesquely inadequate $1.25 in 2005 dollars. The morally relevant comparison of existing poverty, in any case, is not with historical benchmarks but with present possibilities: How much of this poverty is really unavoidable today? By this standard, our generation is doing worse than any in human history. To eliminate severe poverty, the poorer half of humanity would need only six percent of global household income – a shift of just 2.7 percent in their favor. Yet the global distribution is shifting in the opposite direction: The top five percent of humanity gained 2.9 percent of global household income between 1988 and 2008, and now capture nearly half. In the same period, the poorest 30 percent’s share was compressed from 1.52 percent to 1.25 percent, despite all development assistance efforts. The benefit the poor derive from global growth is decimated by the narrowing of their slice of the expanding pie. One crucial driver of national and global income polarization is regulatory capture, called “money in politics” on the left and “crony capitalism” on the right. Corporate and elite interests capture the basic rules of the economic system (governing investment, taxation, trade, intellectual property, etc.), which so profoundly influence the economic distribution. The wealthiest agents have the strongest incentives and also the best opportunities to engage in concerted lobbying, and thus perpetually shift the rules in their own favor. Involving a massive shift of regulation from the national to the supranational level, globalization has opened up a vast new arena for such lobbying. Its prime targets are officials of powerful states – especially in the United States, where political favors are legally for sale, and which still wields unrivaled power in international negotiations. For those with lobbying clout, international rulemaking is typically easier to influence than national legislation. There is no democratic counterweight to contend with. Lack of transparency makes it easy to conceal influence. And moral concerns about proposed rules are easily dismissed with the remark that international relations are a jungle in which we cannot afford to endanger ourselves through moral self-restraints. It is not surprising, then, that the last 30 years have seen the emergence of a dense and influential supranational rule system that favors banks, hedge funds, multinational corporations, and billionaires at the expense of a large majority of the world’s people. Tax cheating and corruption are rife thanks to a worldwide network of tax havens, secrecy ju	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=9433
How big will Russia’s political footprint be in Europe?	The Mark News - Russian influence in Europe after the far right’s success in the European elections of 2014 - By Peter Kreko, director, Political Capital Institute On May 25, the same day that most of the European Union member states voted for the European Parliament, presidential elections took place in Ukraine. In both elections, Russia had an obvious strategy to influence the results. In the case of Ukraine, Russian-supported separatists did everything they could to delegitimize the process in the eastern territories, keeping voters away from the ballot boxes by threatening to shoot people who planned to vote. In the European Parliament elections, the influence was less direct. Russia supports increasingly popular anti-EU parties on the far left and far right, hoping to have pro-Russian caucuses in the next Parliament to help articulate Russian views, and to have an impact on decision-making processes. The tools were different, but the goal was the same: destabilization. The recent crisis in Ukraine has especially revealed the close bonding of European far-right parties with Russia. Many far-right parties (such as the Freedom Party of Austria, the Bulgarian Ataka party, the Italian Northern League, and the Hungarian Jobbik party) have sent “independent observers” to the Crimean referendum, and their representatives in the European Parliament have openly joined forces with some of the far-left parties (including the German Die Linke) to reject a resolution condemning the Crimean annexation and the “destabilization of eastern Ukraine.” Russian influence on the affairs of radical fringe groups is seen all over Europe as a key risk for Euro-Atlantic integration at both the national and the EU level. The recent European Parliament elections resulted in an influx of far-right and far-left euroskeptic and euroreject parties, which now form as much as 27 percent of the assembly. Russian interests will be represented at the highest level of the European Parliament. Spearheaded by the French National Front, far-right parties may join a pro-Russian faction called the European Alliance for Freedom. While some call these forces the “Trojan horse” of Russian interests, they are not hiding their commitment. As one member, the Belgian Vlaams Belang party, has put it, “I think we can be a good partner for Russia in the European Parliament. And Russia sees us as a potential partner.” Such a cooperation between the European far right and Russia dates back many years, and is built upon the policy of “eastern opening,” which emphasizes the economic interests of Europe; an ideological admiration for Russia’s conservative, nationalist, and strong-hand policies; pushing Russia’s agenda on international forums; and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s new foreign policy of Eurasianism as a geopolitical framework. In a 2011 article, Putin promised post-Soviet states national development and “genuine sovereignty,” without the European Union’s “gratuitous restrictions.” Ideology Putin’s reformulated ideology, which is built on conservatism, Christianity, authoritarianism, law-and-order policies, nationalism, and state control over strategic sectors, coincides with the far right’s anti-establishment ideological platform and policy interests. Far-right parties thus appear as natural allies for Russia against the European Union, even though their stated interest in renewed national sovereignty inherently contradicts the Russian interests of expansion and European influence. Networking Through what Putin calls the “active means” of his “Eurasian Doctrine,” Russia provides political and organizational support to “friendly” organizations. In a summary report, researcher Sinikukka Saari describes three major types of Russian support: 1. Contacting and establishing foreign political actors (e.g., in Latvia, where the formerly insignificant Harmony Centre party won the 2011 elections with strong Russian backing). 2. Establishing non-governmental organizations s	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=9527
NEW BEGINNINGS, NEW PROBLEMS	By: Ali Wyne Shortly before U.S. President Barack Obama left for Europe this week, Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes warned that the crisis in Ukraine is not over: “There are people dying on a regular basis in eastern and southern Ukraine, given the violence perpetrated and initiated by separatist factions there. So by no means are we out of the woods.” Still, since Ukraine held a successful presidential election – voting in Petro “Chocolate King” Poroshenko – and Russia has withdrawn most of its troops from the border they share, it is not unreasonable to conclude that the crisis has exited its most critical phase. What does Russia’s balance sheet look like? In addition to annexing Crimea, Russia has formed a Eurasian Economic Union with Belarus and Kazakhstan (Ukraine was supposed to be a member) and signed a $400-billion, 30-year gas deal with China. But in light of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s oft-stated objective – to establish a Eurasian Union that functions as an independent and central actor in international affairs – these victories seem more tactical than strategic. For starters, Russia’s approach to Ukraine has mobilized opposition throughout Europe. True, elections for the European Parliament have strengthened several right-wing populist parties that regard European integration as anathema. (The New York Times observes that they “have been gripped by a contrarian fever of enthusiasm for Russia and its president.”) Even this fringe support, however, seems more opportunistic than organic, driven less by the desire for a Eurasian Union than by the hope that supporting Russian foreign policy in the short term will weaken the prevailing European order. Looking beyond Europe, far-reaching economic and diplomatic pushback from the West have compelled Russia to accelerate its rebalance to the Asia-Pacific, where it seeks, above all, to strengthen its relationship with China. But while Sino-Russian relations are indeed growing stronger, they are also growing more lopsided – in China’s favor. China is a rising power that needs vital commodities. Russia is a declining power that needs to cultivate the perception of strategic alignment and ideological solidarity with China to be deemed a major power. This asymmetry presents Russia with a predicament: Beyond what threshold will its efforts to curry favor with China effectively render it a supplicant? Fearful of this outcome, and mindful that Chinese influence is overtaking its own across Central Asia (which was firmly within its orbit as recently as a decade ago), Russia is also trying to curry favor with bitter antagonists of China, including Japan and Vietnam. If and when China assesses that these hedging efforts have gone too far, it can leverage its prodigious economic influence to change Russia’s calculus. More isolated by the West and more dependent on China, Russia is in a less favorable strategic position than it was at the beginning of the year. Less clear, however, is how its incursion into Crimea will change Europe’s defense posture. In June 2011, in his last policy address as U.S. Defense Secretary, Robert Gates famously lamented that NATO had become “a two-tiered alliance,” with the United States accounting for more than three-quarters of the entire alliance’s defense spending. He warned that it could succumb to “collective military irrelevance” if that imbalance persisted, and that if it did, America’s future leaders might not “consider the return on America’s investment in NATO worth the cost.” While some of America’s European allies have vowed to contribute more to their own security, the developments of recent years are not encouraging. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen noted last month that “Russian defence spending has grown by more than 10 percent in real terms each year over the past five years. … By contrast, several European NATO countries have cut their defence spending by more than 20 percent over the same period. … And the c	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=9808
THE INVISIBLE WOMAN	The Mark News By Beryl Richards Since 2012, I’ve been looking at why there seem to be fewer and fewer women directing TV drama and film in the United Kingdom. I’ve been a freelance TV drama and comedy director for many years, and I’m currently vice chair of Directors UK, the main professional body for the 5,000 film and TV directors working in the United Kingdom. I started out thinking that there seemed to be fewer women directing in the industry, and that in order to change things we just needed to make producers a bit more aware of this. I now believe the only way anything will change is if we set targets and monitor, measure, and deliver results within a specified timeframe. We began by examining and analyzing program credits to see if male and female directors were experiencing the same employment opportunities. In our sample we analyzed more than 28,000 episodes of 142 long-running and popular shows across many areas of TV over 10 years. The detailed data we have sourced shows patterns of behavior that indicate systemic discrimination. Our report, Women Directors – Who’s Calling the Shots?, has prompted much debate as to why female directors are so underrepresented, and how we can redress the balance. Our report shows, among other things, a downward trend in the employment of female directors in much of drama, comedy, and entertainment: • “Only 11% of all drama series and serial episodes were directed by women in 2011 and 2012; down from 15% in the total sample.” • “Only 9% directed detective/crime serials in 2011 and 12.” • “0% of sci-fi/fantasy genre drama episodes were directed by women in 2011 and 2012; down from 4% of the total sample.” In fact, many popular drama, entertainment, and comedy shows have never been directed by a woman. A recent report published by the British Film Institute shows similar patterns for the film industry. What concerns us is the lack of a female perspective in film and TV. Women make up 51 percent of the population, yet film and TV drama is largely excluding our view of the world. A key aspect of our research findings was the invisibility of women to those who commission work and hire directors. Before we published our report, we had private meetings with executives at broadcast and production companies to see what they thought of our results. All were shocked by our findings – they had no idea the numbers were so low. They hadn’t noticed. Many pointed out that there are a lot of women in executive producer and management roles, but it was clear that they knew of very few female directors. There were a trusted five or six female directors in drama or comedy that they often sought, but if they were not available, the job went to a man (or, as many executives said, “the best person for the job”). Many of the people we met with suggested mentoring or training courses as a remedy. There is little evidence that this approach has had any meaningful effect, and it certainly seems inadequate when discussing such a huge disparity. Training and mentoring might help to get more women into the workforce, but our biggest concern is the employment of the talented women who are already there. There was also an assumption that there are few female directors because directing is incompatible with child care. The female directors around the table, including some of the “trusted few,” corrected them on this. Most of them had children. They had managed this transition, and worked in all areas of film and TV. Women make up 27 percent of Directors UK’s membership, and 35–44 is the age band with the most female directors. There are plenty of us out there. In TV, a significant shift of power has resulted in risk-averse behavior. Hiring decisions regarding directors that were once made at the producer level are now subject to commissioner approval. Our data shows that the same known-name directors are being used again and again, and almost all of them are men. Very few female directors are known at the commission	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=9984
Patching the front hem with the back hem	By M.OYUNGEREL The Mongolian phrase “patching the front hem with the back hem” perfectly describes Mongolia’s economy in the past. Making short-sighted decisions to cope with a lack of resources and spending extravagantly at the hint of money without thinking about the future. Sound familiar? Although Mongolians are extremely good at following foreign culture and banging their chests with the mention of their history and of their historically renowned leader Chinggis Khaan, who redrew the world map as often as he wanted, we Mongolians are also extremely bad at learning from the same history we chant and the histories of the countries that we so admire. But the Prime Minister’s speech at the Mongolian Economic Forum: Lessons, Challenges, and Solutions on March 31 gave me hope that we’ve learned and that we have development potential. Instead of the dramatic – impossible even – promises, and phrases such as “becoming the next Asian tiger” and “rapid development”, the forum heard wiser and more grown-up phrases such as “the need to save economic surplus” and “policies in line with the state budget”. The Prime Minister listed the places where the country went wrong. According to President of Mongolbank N.Zoljargal, the fact that we didn’t save or circulate economic surplus during our economic boom is the lesson. The challenge is to decrease dependency on mining and diversify the economy, and the solution is to implement the New Balance policy. The New Balance policy emphasizes sustainable debt management and a balanced budget. MP S.Bayartsogt noted that fish have five-second memories and parliamentarians have four-year memories. He said that it was essential for Mongolia to get out of this cycle for long-term sustainable development. It’s not only in Mongolia where parliamentarians work to get re-elected. The main issue is that the majority of the Mongolian public has a shorter memory than the parliamentarians. The people meant to monitor the implementation of policies and the decisions of the state are lacking in enough awareness to allow politicians to get away with their wrongdoings. James Anderson, Resident Country Representative of World Bank in Mongolia, said that Mongolia is experiencing positive progress, such as establishing the Independent Authority Against Corruption and laws on transparency and budget sustainability. He noted that Mongolia needs to pay attention to public inclusion when developing laws, as it raises public awareness. Let’s say politicians wanted to have a longer memory than normal parliamentarians, that they wanted to include the public’s voice when making laws to encourage public participation, and implemented the New Balance policy. How developed a country would Mongolia become? I can only hope and wait to see what the people I choose next June remember, that they follow these words and turn them into action. Even if these changes were implemented, you might ask, “What about foreign debt and pre-existing problems?” Without a doubt, a common fear prevails in people’s hearts when politicians start talking about debt. It seems to me that questions such as “Will we end up adopting the Chinese yuan as our currency like Zimbabwe?” and “Will we go into default and spend months and years in economic hardship like Greece?” are actually made up by politicians to control the public. As Donald Trump continues to prove through his unimaginably successful electoral bid for the U.S. presidency, that fear appeals to the public more than hope, I suspect that Mongolia is already being ruled by fear. But according to Professor L.Oyun at the Finance Department of the School of Economics at the National University of Mongolia, separating the terms “debt” and “loan” are essential to understand when talking about debt in the first place. L.Oyun says that debt refers to a loan that hasn’t been paid in time. I don’t know if politicians don’t know the difference between the terms, or if they use the fact that the public can’	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19089
Argentina trapped in debt	Argentina is an emerging nation currently considered to be one of Latin America’s three largest economies. With an area of 2.5 million square kilometers dominated by agriculture, Argentina has a population of 43 million, 80 percent of which are of Western European descent and the rest coming from Spain and Italy. Argentina’s GDP per capita is approximately 14,000 USD. If Argentina had paid back its foreign loans on time and sustainably implemented the economic reform they started in the 90s, they would have had developed much faster than they are today. In 2001, the Argentine government announced a default on its sovereign debt of 100 billion USD acquired in bonds. Their economy declined for the fourth year by 2003 and was reduced by 20 percent. Unemployment reached 25 percent while the peso, Argentina’s national currency, fell 400 percent in its exchange rate against USD. Armies of unemployed people appeared in every city and were trying to make their living by collecting and selling salvaged materials, such as cardboard boxes and scrap metal. The media named them “cartoneras”. For a while, the cartoneras replaced Carlos Gardel, Evita, and Maradona as Argentina’s symbolic citizens. In the 90s – almost 10 years before the 2001 default happened – Argentina, which was crippled with hyperinflation, fixed the peso to the U.S dollar, freed its foreign trade, reduced government involvement in the economy, and started privatizing state-owned enterprises. As a result, the economy grew 30 percent in four years as the inflation rate decreased to a single-digit number. However, then President Carlos Menem did not continue this change, and focused more on internal political conflicts. He was eventually detained in his residence after connections were made to him being involved in a secret arms trade. It is said that he was exonerated later on because he increased the number of judges on the Supreme Court from five to nine and got his own people in. Néstor Kirchner, who became the President of Argentina in 2003, pursued an economic expansionary policy. Due to an increase in prices for Argentina’s main export products, such as corn and beef, the economy grew again. It created five million jobs and brought a great amount of capital into internal expenditure and real estate. Some privatized companies, such as the pension fund, national post, airlines, and railway enterprises, were transferred back to state ownership. Countries that can no longer pay back foreign loans see their credit ratings fall to the lowest rates while their unpaid bonds become junk bonds. Therefore, such countries (and their private sector) become unable to raise capital by borrowing from abroad. Without access to the international capital market, any country will lose the normal conditions for economic growth and have much more limited opportunities to attract foreign investment and bring new technology in. Argentina found no success despite taking many measures to settle its foreign debts after announcing their default. With the objective of bond restructuring, the Government of Argentina proposed buying their bonds back at 30 percent of their value in 2005 and in 2010. The proposal was accepted by 97 percent of bond owners. The value of Argentina’s bonds kept falling after every trade since the default, so the bond owners found it acceptable to exchange the bonds at 30 percent of their value. However, seven percent of all bonds were already held by vulture funds. Hedge funds, that also go by the name of “vulture funds”, purchase distressed securities like defaulted bonds at cheaper prices, and generate large profits by forcing the bond issuers to pay the full, original price. Former President Cristina Kirchner described these hedge funds as “vultures” when the hedge funds were forcing her to buy the bonds at a price 10 times higher than what they had paid. The vulture funds then attempted to seize Argentina’s state-owned properties , such as their ships and aircrafts	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19114
Marching off a cliff	By B.KHASH-ERDENE “Economic crisis”, “financial pressure”, and “Who is to blame?” seem to be on everyone’s lips. The people of Mongolia are feeling the struggle of the country’s crawling economy. Businesses aren’t able to pay their workers on time, small shops and cafes all over the city are closing their doors, herders and farmers don’t have cash to start planting or to take care of their animals, banks are frantic about bad loans, and everyone’s tightening their belts. Mongolia’s foreign debts, which were estimated to be 11.6 billion USD in 2012, skyrocketed to 21.7 billion USD in 2015. This includes the Chinggis Bonds (1.5 billion USD) and Samurai Bonds (30 billion JPY, or approximately 274 million USD) issued under former Prime Minister N.Altankhuyag. N.Altankhuyag caused quite a sensation when he said that there was a conspiracy being led by President Ts.Elbegdorj to jeopardize the economy and consolidate power. “There is a crisis of justice looming over us,” said N.Altankhuyag. “By making it look like the state of Mongolia is weak, the rule of conspirators is gaining power. Those who are not true to their nation, those who have insatiable greed, are shamelessly using the powers of the state for their own personal interests. They are suppressing the desire of Mongolians to live in Mongolia prosperously, screwing up the state by overthrowing it, scaring away wealth creators, and using the threat of imprisonment instead of justice to spread fear and openly steal from businesses and [mining] license holders,” the former Prime Minister said at a press conference last week. He claimed that the Democratic Party is being attacked by conspirators. “This state of conspiracy is deliberately attacking the credibility of the Democratic Party. The accomplishments and works of the Democratic Party are being made to look bad, and efforts to sabotage and make it look like the Democratic Party can’t run the state are being organized. During all this, the opposition party, the Mongolian People’s Party is staying quiet, silently satisfied. Don’t forget this.” N.Altankhuyag said that the conspirators are led by President Ts.Elbegdorj. “I have no choice today but to name one of the heads of the conspiracy. Though everyone knows this, they dare not speak out… Because they fear persecution. This person is President Ts.Elbegdorj, who came to power by saying ‘let’s be honest’,” N.Altankhuyag said. “No doubt they will place blame and act as if they are working against corruption and appeal to the public. Though me and my associates might be in danger, I’m not afraid.” Some observers and media believe that N.Altankhuyag’s statement is politically motivated and that he hopes to shift the blame for the debt he put Mongolia in. Not all debt is bad. If used wisely or invested well, loans can serve as much needed fuel for the engine of the economy. But when a nation’s debt burden reaches a certain point, it is sure to take a toll on everyone. Right now, it seems that things are rough all around, but the worst is yet to come. No matter who wins the elections, Mongolia will have to pay approximately two billion USD in debt repayment next year, including 900 million USD in debt belonging to the private sector. Mongolia currently devotes around six to seven percent of its state budget revenue to debt repayment. Economists believe that this number will grow as high as 25 percent of the state’s budget revenue. To add salt to the wound, the country’s foreign debt has been accrued in foreign currency, which means that at the current rate by which the value of the MNT is plummeting, there will be more pressure when Mongolia’s government bond repayments are due in 2017, 2018, 2022, and 2023. While the payment due dates of these debts are looming over the nation, the state continues to ignore demands for a report on bond related matters. The government has never made the details of its bond expenditure public. As the parliamentary and provincial elections approac	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19183
Government reform is the way out of crisis	Having continued to decline, Mongolia’s economy has almost stopped growing today. Our economy is seeing a deficit of cash, and most businesses, especially those in the mining industry, are not able to pay back their loans or pay employee salaries. Foreign investment has halted while the budget deficit reaches one trillion tugrug every year. The government is trying to settle its debts by borrowing more from domestic and foreign markets. The five-year bonds that the government has recently issued to the foreign capital market have an interest rate of more than 10 percent, which is more than the rates of commercial banks. It shows how huge Mongolia’s political and economic risks have grown. Unless certain and prompt measures are taken, many companies will go bankrupt because of their debt. It will be followed by the collapse of banks and the government will become unable to pay its employees. Unemployment will spread, the tugrug will weaken, and prices will increase. It will trigger people to move abroad in search of jobs. The economy will slump, and it will have to be formally announced that we are in crisis if another quarter sees negative results. Representatives of Mongolia’s public, social, and private sectors met in Ulaanbaatar last week for an annual economic forum to discuss the underlying cause of the economic decline and how to overcome it. UNDERLYING CAUSE OF ECONOMIC DECLINE Mongolia’s President Ts.Elbegdorj explains that there are two reasons why our economy has almost stopped growing. One is that politicians were not able to take advantage of a big opportunity by moving the huge mining projects forward when commodity prices were high. He referenced it with the Mongolian phrase “pushing away the butter in your mouth”. The other reason is the lack of an accountability system in our politics. President Ts.Elbegdorj said that the politicians were “dancing on the butter they wasted”. On the other hand, Prime Minister Ch.Saikhanbileg explains that there are three underlying causes of the economic decline. The first cause is that Mongolians have an unhealthy mindset when it comes to the economy. The next is that we are destroying more than we are creating. The third reason he outlined was that the accountable political parties are failing to work together. Speaker of Parliament Z.Enkhbold believes that the reason our economy has heavily declined is closely associated with what is happening in the external environment. He said that the decrease in China’s demand made our economy slow down and created uncertainties. Speaker Z.Enkhbold said that the main culprit keeping strategic projects stuck is not the parliament, and that the deal to give the Tavan Tolgoi project to two companies for 60 years with a royalty of only two percent was not profitable for Mongolia. M.Khaliunbat, who is the executive director of the Silk Road Foundation, said that the economic decline today was caused by crony capitalism. He used the construction and banking sectors as an example, and explained that no business in Mongolia can operate successfully unless it has political ties. M.Khaliunbat explained that the housing mortgage program is not sustainable in the long run, because it is selling expensive apartments with low interest rate mortgages, while freezing the prices that would have eventually gone down due to excessive supply compared to demand. He noted that the mortgage program is increasing the total assets of the banking sector, and has housing loans making up almost half of all loans, which is resulting in an increase of bad loans. He concluded that the monopolization of the construction and banking sectors is a clear reflection of the interests of politicians who have businesses in these two industries. It could be seen from the remarks of participants of the forum and those who addressed the audience, that, despite the external factors contributing to the economic decline, the hardships we face today are largely down to the capabilit	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19229
The seesaw of meat prices	Trans. by B.DULGUUN Meat prices have skyrocketed once again. In just ten days, prices for all types of meat suddenly increased by 1,000 to 1,500 MNT per kg. Mongolians have had the luxury of eating plenty of meat as meat prices have been relatively low in recent months. The cost for a lamb carcass dropped to 3,500 MNT per kg at the beginning of 2016, surprising consumers with long awaited good news. But, it seems that consumers got used to these low prices, resulting in their immediate frustration and complaints when news of rising meat prices broke out. In truth, meat prices are returning to what they were three years ago. Prices actually aren’t going through the roof. Now, a kilogram of goat meat costs 5,500 MNT, a kilogram of lamb costs 7,500 MNT, and beef costs 8,500 MNT per kg at the Khuchit Shonkhor food market, which is known to be the cheapest market in Ulaanbaatar. If you can remember, meat prices were 500 MNT higher two years ago than current prices. There was a time when the cost of a kilogram of beef exceeded 10,000 MNT at Khuchit Shonkhor. Some people explain the sudden price increase as the “natural course of life”. Meat prices surge every spring in Mongolian markets. The reason is very simple. “Prices have increased due to a scarcity of meat” is the normal response meat suppliers give. This time is no different, and meat suppliers are giving the same explanation. The state used to stock up on meat to prevent a sudden price increase resulting from a low supply. The state didn’t reserve meat this year, causing the extreme rise in meat prices. Still, the public is full of hope for a price drop. From 2013 to 2015, Mongol Bank used to run a program to stabilize the prices of consumer goods. Meat was reserved all year round and supplied to the market in spring when there’s a low supply of meat. Mongolia used to reserve 14,000 tons of meat annually, managing to overcome spring’s low meat supply. Also, the state enacted a policy to increase the livestock population and increase provisions that impact meat prices. In 2015, Mongol Bank handed over its price stabilization program for consumer goods to the government, and the state took charge of preparing meat reserves and regulating the market. The Ministry of Food and Agriculture also developed the Meat Program to support domestic meat suppliers and exporters with concessional financing of 100 billion MNT. Had the program been approved, Development Bank would have provided concessional loans to people in the meat industry, not to mention stocking up on a significant amount of meat. A representative from Mongol Bank stated that meat prices wouldn’t have increased so rapidly if meat had been reserved, and pointed out that the Mongolian Meat Association should have enforced the price stablization program. Mongolia typically faces a meat shortage from April to June. Experts say that Mongolia will not encouter a meat shortage this year as a result of herders slaughtering a larger than average number of livestock last fall as a precaution against a severe winter. The Ministry of Food and Agriculture announced last year that herders were planning to slaughter 15 million livestock, and that 10 million livestock would fully supply domestic needs. The ministry also supported exporting 100,000 tons of meat from the remaining five million livestock. However, the amount of processed meat from livestock didn’t meet domestic demand, making it impossible to export a large amount of meat. So where is all this processed meat now? Meat from five million livestock is probably enough to feed the whole population of Mongolia for half a year. As stated by the ministry, a relatively large number of livestock was slaughtered for meat and most of the meat was not exported, which means that Mongolia shouldn’t be facing a meat shortage at the moment. If there’s no shortage, meat prices shouldn’t be rising. According to rumors being spread at trade centers, meat distribution centers have a lot of m	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19265
Battle of puppets	By B.KHASH-ERDENE The public was sorely reminded of the 2012 arrest of former President N.Enkhbayar when the police and a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team was seen raiding the offices of parliamentarian Kh.Battulga’s companies at Bayangol Hotel Office on April 10. Deja vu Most people were disturbed to see a former President being escorted unceremoniously, carried upside down by masked special police in non-regulation attire. Friends and supporters of Kh.Battulga feared for exactly that scenario and gathered at Bayangol Hotel Office to prevent his arrest. The media and the public thought that Kh.Battulga was being arrested, but the economic crimes division and the Independent Authority Against Corruption (IAAC) claimed that they were only there to investigate Kh.Battulga’s two companies – Tumen Khishigten LLC and Bayalgiin Khuvi LLC – and not to arrest Kh.Battulga. “There was a need to review the financial documents of Tumen Khishigten LLC and Bayalgiin Khuvi LLC in relation to the New Railway and Sainshand projects. These two companies are headquartered at Bayangol Hotel Office and we are searching the companies’ offices with permission from the prosecutor. We are not here to arrest parliamentarian Kh.Battulga,” said General Police Department spokesperson B.Baatarkhuu. Chaos and disorder Many on social media believed that the police and SWAT team were at Bayangol Hotel Office to arrest Kh.Battulga, and claimed that they couldn’t conduct the arrest because many people gathered there to oppose their actions, including the national men’s judo team. More than 40 judokas came in a hurry from the nearby National Olympic Committee building, where they were training, after hearing news that the Mongolian Judo Association’s president, Kh.Battulga, was being arrested. To support this claim, local media was reporting that there were snipers placed at Gereg Tower near Bayangol Hotel, and some reporters questioned why it was necessary for the SWAT team to be involved in the confiscation of financial documents from private companies being investigated for a non-violent crime. The same issue was raised when N.Enkhbayar was arrested. TV9 broadcasted the whole thing, and the public saw the raiding of the former President’s house from the inside. It left a bitter aftertaste, and people witnessed the brutality and excessive force used by law enforcement even when suspects are obedient and unarmed. State Honored attorney S.Narangerel told Chuhal.mn, “I saw the press conference given by the General Police Department. They explained that they brought the special forces to address the possibility of resistance when confiscating documents. This can’t be. What does it mean when they use so much force just to confiscate documents from two regular companies? If this is the norm now, we can forget about human rights. This is fascism, a one-person tyranny.” Kh.Battulga’s assistant was arrested on the morning of the raid. So it was no surprise that hundreds of people gathered when the heavily armed five-hour search was taking place at Bayangol Hotel Office. The gathering also drew politicians and celebrities, including Members of Parliament J.Batzandan (Head of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Petitions), G.Uyanga, and B.Garamgaibaatar (Head of the Democratic Party group in Parliament), as well as M.Zorigt (Minister of Roads and Transportation), Mayor E.Bat-Uul, former sumo grand champion D.Dagvadorj, and Olympic judo champion N.Tuvshinbayar. People from Bayankhongor Province, Kh.Battulga’s electoral district, also came to support the politician. Bayankhongor resident N.Odnoo told Eagle News, “Over 500 vehicles left Bayankhongor [to support Kh.Battulga]. We will not lose our steadfast state representative this way.” After the incident, Kh.Battulga gave a short statement to the press and people gathered at Bayangol Hotel Office, and claimed that the raid was part of a plot to discredit him, “They brought a lot of police on purpose, to make th	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19287
Regional development policy and the role of the younger generation	Although Mongolia is three times bigger than France in terms of territory, our population is only three million people divided into 21 provinces and one capital city. Given that half of the population lives in the capital, it is time to thoroughly discuss how to carry out regional development in our country with equity and make smart decisions. If the current trend keeps up, and people keep moving from rural locations to urban areas, from soums to aimag centers, and from aimags to the capital, who will live in the countryside, take care of the vast land, and continue the animal husbandry that is the core of Mongolia’s nomadic culture? Due to urbanization taking place globally, Mongolia’s younger generation increasingly prefers to stay close to and live in urban settlements instead of pursuing herding and farming. In other countries people do not flock to a single city, because their regional towns are well developed and have their own identities and special features. Could Mongolia have three large hubs: western, central, and eastern? Could every aimag be a unique center of their respective region? How can the full potential of regional development be achieved? What is the best economic policy to implement? Why is the role of the younger generation crucial? REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT POLICY The Economic Policy and Competitiveness Research Center recently published its 4th annual report on aimag competitiveness. Aimags were ranked after processing data covering 180 parameters, two thirds of which were statistical calculations and the rest came from surveys. The ranking was done with the general competitiveness index (aimag GDP per capita, unemployment rate, inflation rate, etc.) and four major indicators (economic performance, governance efficiency, business efficiency, and infrastructure). It appears that Orkhon Province led the list, followed by Dundgobi in 2015. More information can be found at aimagindex.mn. This report provides us with a general picture we can zoom in on to look at the nation’s economic conditions, business environment, and the employment levels of aimags to make comparisons. However, it does not show us what products produced in which aimags are competitive in their industry, or which are capable of entering the international market. But it should be noted that this analysis is not the objective of this report in the first place. We call a business competitive when it exports its products abroad after meeting domestic demand. Only such companies can make an aimag or a region competitive and ensure a sustainable economy. Otherwise, at this time when commodity prices continue to fall, we can see that extracting and exporting resources brings about only short-term achievement. In order to make aimags competitive, Mongolia’s tax policy needs to go through a structural change. History tells us that regions cannot achieve development without giving aimags and towns the right to set local tax rates, collect those taxes, and decide for themselves how to spend local tax revenue. Up to 40 percent of tax revenue and expenditures such as healthcare, pensions, and social welfare should be governed locally by aimags. Only then will aimags be able to develop and will we see people choosing to live there permanently. Local tax governance would also allow for competition between aimags. In order to create jobs, aimags should start implementing good policies, such as those directed at reducing the amount of taxes they govern to ensure that as many businesses as possible are set up in their community. Also, aimags should be able to establish specific, competitive industrial clusters. BAGS ARE THE CORE OF REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT The underlying reason why herders are moving away from the countryside is associated with property regulations. Besides their livestock, herders need to be able to own their winter camp locations, and share pastures with other households in their bag (a bag is the smallest regional administrative unit in Mon	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19342
The ASEM drama directed by state officials	By Ch.KHALIUN This year Mongolia is organizing the 11th Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) Summit from July 15 to 16 in Ulaanbaatar. Since the news of Mongolia hosting the summit was first announced, Mongolia’s leaders started placing a high priority on the meeting. Of course, ASEM is an opportunity for Mongolia to promote the country, and many people see the summit as a chance Mongolia cannot pass up. The Cabinet created a special working group in charge of organizing the summit, and they have been taking many measures to improve the city’s landscape. The Cabinet approved a budget of 20 billion MNT for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to pay for the summit’s organization. China is providing 15 million USD in assistance for the purchase of goods and products required for the summit, while some European countries are helping in organizing one the summit’s sub-conferences, according to a government report. It is also reported that the private sector is supplying cars and building villas for the summit’s guests, funded through loans from Development Bank of Mongolia. The Mongolian Hotel Association and Office of the President reported that nearly 200 billion MNT will be spent for hotel upgrades to serve delegates from over 50 countries. The money is being issued in loans to hotels. On April 8, a total of 52 Toyota Prius 30s, valued at 3.4 billion MNT, were handed over to police for use during ASEM. Deputy Chairman of the ASEM Organizing Committee B.Baysgalan said that preparation for the summit is being carried out in accordance with plans. He said, “Together, with the private sector, we are resolving the issue of cars to serve summit guests. We will import 250 new cars. Currently, we are working to exempt taxes for these cars. The government will not spend money on this issue. Estimates suggest that around 350 cars will be required for the summit guests. We are conducting studies on cars used by ministries, private entities, and citizens that could be used for serving ASEM guests.” “The Ministry of Roads and Transportation is implementing a project on inter-urban public transportation. Under the project, the ministry negotiated to buy over 300 buses through concessional loans from the Republic of Korea. First, we will buy 50 buses before the summit. During the summit, namely from July 15 to 16, the central road will be closed,” Baysgalan said. Last week, Mayor of Ulaanbaatar E.Bat-Uul decided to spend three billion MNT to repaint sidewalks and pavement, remove and replace pavement, build bicycle paths, take down fences that don’t meet standards, renovate building facades in the city center, and on other renovation projects, such as resolving lighting issues in residential areas. Even though the summit is a chance for promoting Mongolia, its organization shouldn’t burden the lives of citizens. State officials, including Prime Minister Ch.Saikhanbileg, called on Ulaanbaatarians to spend time in the countryside during the two-day meeting. Of course, the public is criticizing these requests to make sacrifices, and are asking each other if the state is ashamed of its citizens. Recently, local media is reporting that the Mayor’s Office released an order to suspend the operations of some roadside shoe repair shops, canteens, and kiosks as part of the ASEM city beautification effort. Kiosk owners say that officials from district Production and Services departments are pressuring these small business owners to close their businesses until August 20. Kiosk operator S.Munkhbat said, “I rent a modern kiosk that meets design standards approved by the Mayor’s Office. I pay 750,000 MNT for rent every month. But how am I supposed to live and how am I supposed to pay for rent if the city administration is not allowing me to operate?” B.Erdenechimeg, an expert from the Production and Services Department of Bayangol District, said, “We are demanding that business owners suspend their activities following an order from our authorities. This isn’t only rela	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19381
The War on Terror through the Mongolian lens	By Hassan Butt Since the dawn of McCarthyism, America’s policymakers have wandered around the pastures of minority politics like second-rate gardeners. If pundits have ever needed to search for a resurgence of anti-intellectualism and baseless smears in American politics, they may not need look further than the demagoguery of Donald J. Trump. But the veracity of much of the West’s political story goes much further than a few promised walls and a barrage of anti-Islamic and Mexican sentiment; its bludgeoning hilt, for too long now, has been the efferent “War on Terror”. But what meaning, if any, does the “War on Terror” have for Mongolians? How does a country geographically withdrawn from the gamut of insurgent activity consume global narratives on terrorism? At first glance, the questions offered might seemingly function at a macro, geopolitical level. Yet Islam’s inclusion into the folds of an ongoing political rhetoric has at once grounded the issue as an equally communal one, and one that certainly requires positive, informed, and open-minded discussion. For Sarangua, a translator, reporter and former Foreign News Editor at NTV (Mongolia’s 4th largest television station), the coverage of terrorism is always a “shaky issue”. This is primarily because NTV’s broadcasting standards mirror Mongolia’s widely held political stance on “neutrality at all costs”. For NTV, international news “has to be informative” and often there are domestic issues covered that broadly encompass national intelligence, disaster relief, and other security precautions. Yet, concerning Islam and its presence in Mongolian media, Sarangua conceded to the straight lines of censorship and sensitivity, “We receive world news, and we just translate it; BBC, the Agence France-Presse, and so on.” With regards to how that particular information is processed, Sarangua added, “We used to have a show called ‘World News Review’, where we chose one topic and usually included an interview with a political expert.” When asked if the “War on Terror” had ever been part of that review show, she responded, “No, maybe it’s too scary.” But what might this mean for Mongolia’s sparse Islamic community? Approximately three to five percent of Mongolia’s population is Muslim. The majority of this particular demographic is predominately Kazakh in ethnicity, widely populating the westernmost provinces of Mongolia. With Ulaanbaatar possessing almost half the country’s 2.8 million population, Islam is certainly one of the least domestically visible cultural components. For Fatima, one of Mongolia’s few converts to Islam, the preservation and portrayal of a harmonious, peaceful, and tolerant religion is of utmost importance. Fatima’s induction into her religion was twofold; she first had to educate herself, and then those who surrounded her. Seventeen years later, and she has certainly succeeded in the former. A keen linguist, she has gained fluency in various languages, including Arabic, Urdu, and Hindi. Her community efforts have shined through. In 2015 she crowd-funded Ulaanbaatar’s first Islamic library, and has spent her own money and time perfecting many Quranic translations from Arabic to Mongolian. With regards to the more media-focused, global aspects of Islam, Fatima spoke of great unhappiness, “This is just my opinion, but [news outlets] have often shown the bad face of Islam, making people enemies of each other for interest, never focusing on Islam’s message of peace.” On a domestic level, Fatima’s approach to the pressing questions of safeguarding national interests were forthright, “I agree that policy and intelligence must be correct. They may need to check us, people have jobs for that, it’s national security. But when you ask me, ‘Why are you collecting these books? Why are you teaching Arabic? What are you going to do?’ This is actually rude.” Her clear and concise insight into the Mongolian Constitution had echoed through at this point, “We have a constitutional ri	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19428
FROM BLACK TO BLUE	Professor Gunter Pauli says that an economy reaches sustainability when it is ensured that people’s basic needs are met by using what is locally available. Focusing on this, he developed a new business model to supply high quality goods at cheap prices to the market. Pauli proved in practice that this business model can bring about many advantages besides business profits. He first developed the model in 1994, when he was taking part in the preparatory work for the Kyoto Protocol on climate change at the request of the United Nations. In the last 20 years, Pauli has implemented almost 200 projects and created thousands of jobs. He proved that a business which carries out such a number of projects and provides employment can still be competitive in the international market and keep increasing their profits. It was contrary to the traditional model, where large corporations want to increase their production by seizing cheaper labor, taking advantage of the supply chain that allows a timely delivery of standard products. This traditional model leads to an increase in unemployment and widens gaps in society. What Pauli’s model says is that individuals and enterprises should adapt to the changes in their environment by further developing their original business ideas, and creating more businesses that have a positive impact on society. If a business seeks to achieve its full potential, it can create more interconnected businesses, which would increase the total positive benefits. Pauli proved it in practice with a coffee business. A business that mainly sells coffee started using grounds from its coffee to grow mushrooms, and made animal fodder out of the waste that came from the mushrooms. It brought two additional sources of income to the coffee business. Besides additional sources of income, it also increases the cash flow of the local economy. It increases employment and boosts the purchasing power of residents, which helps the sales of other businesses. When financial capabilities improve, there will be fewer funds allocated for social care in the public budget, and more will be available for construction and development projects. Almost 90 percent of the value added to the price of food products comes from international and domestic transportation. If food products are produced locally, it will remove the costs associated with transportation and allow for high quality products to be delivered at cheaper prices. The mushrooms grown by using coffee grounds are now supplied to many cities in the world at cheap prices. Furthermore, Pauli’s model has changed the principles of many business models and resulted in initiatives such as using rock to make paper, making shoes and clothes out of coffee grounds, and growing forests on empty land. These initiatives created countless jobs that help the local economy. Why is a “blue economy” suitable for Mongolia? Pauli named the economic model based on his business model “Blue”, and says that it is a deeper concept than a “globalized economy” or “green economy”. Green or renewable energy requires more funds from the public budget, and organic products are made at greater costs. Therefore, even though these two initiatives have been successful, they can only produce their true benefits in a prosperous country with people who can spend money on them. In contrast, a blue economy is solely based on new ideas, profitability, and creating jobs. As a blue economy has its own business model and requires a high cost to make a substantial change to the model, it is not suitable for large corporations. However, it offers countless opportunities to the younger generation and those who are seeking to set up a new business. A blue economy is mostly based on laws of physics such as gravity, and sees air pressure and temperature in a given local ecosystem as decisive factors. Nature is a system that creates food and energy, and does not create any waste in the sense that any product that could be consider	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19451
B.Oyu: I wish to play amazing pieces by Mongolian composers who haven’t been recognized in Asia	A pianist’s profession is a complex one that requires high skills. Not everyone with musical talents are able to become a professional pianist. The following is an interview with rising pianist B.Oyungerel, also known as B.Oyu, about the music industry and other relevant issues. Why did you change your name to Oyu? My parents gave me the name Oyungerel, but there were many cases of mispronunciation at foreign and domestic competitions and events. I switched to Oyu in order to make it easier to pronounce as well as to pursue the standards set for artists to have a stage name. Thousands of people are aspiring and making various works for the ever-difficult classical arts. The number of Mongolian pianists entering foreign music circles is considerably low. In general, how developed is piano music in Mongolian? Mongolia is able to teach the basics incredibly well. All of my instructors studied in Russia. There’s an academy for only classical arts in Russia. It’s a major success that Mongolia was able to learn from Russia’s experience and establish the academy in Mongolia. Although the basics are taught well, musicians aren’t able to train. Training to become a full-fledged musician isn’t solely dependent on instructors. Abundant intellect and funds are required. It also depends on many other aspects other than these contributions. I hope the ministry and other relevant organizations unite someday and face one another head-on and accept their shortcomings. Truthfully, young artists aren’t acknowledged. Their accomplished works aren’t recognized as it should. When they criticize the reality, they receive immense countercharge and get accused of disrespecting their elders. Even though Mongolians claim that we’re talented and skilled, we’re unable to qualify for the second round of A [high] level competitions. This is a fact. The competitions we enter aren’t of B level but of C level that are organized for amateurs. When I took several children with me to Italy to participate in a competition, children who trained at the Music and Dance College of Mongolia, a vocational school, they won 100 Euros in prize or a certificate from competing against children who learned at home. When they returned to Mongolia, they got 14 million MNT from the state. This isn’t development, but destruction. Instructors and children aren’t entering competitions for improving skills. Why can’t that 14 million MNT reward be used for musical education? We should spend it on training children who are trying to take part in A level competitions. For instance, [the government] can become responsible for food, rent, and all other needs of children taking part in A level competitions. I made three appointments to discuss this issue with the minister but unfortunately, I wasn’t able to meet her. Glooming over it will not solve anything. We need to search for other means and opportunities to resolve the issue. In Europe, people focus on educating children through classical arts. It’s the same in Mongolia. There are tons of people who are interested in learning piano as an adult. Is it very different to learn piano at a young age than learning it when you’re older? People at any age can learn to play the piano. The significance of learning to play at a young age is that it’s not only a matter of learning music. It becomes their upbringing and education and helps them mature. Many people are discussing education as it’s become a standard. It’s classified depending on whether it’s an education for the brain, spirituality, or upbringing. If it’s taught at early ages, it becomes a comprehensive education for these aspects. A 30-year-old can learn to play instruments. However, it will not affect their mentality since they’ve already matured and developed their individual views of the world. The most appropriate age to teach instruments is when children are four or five. It’s the time when they start growing, understand ethics and morals, and start developing different emot	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=11233
N.Gaamaa: Everything will be resolved if housing issues are settled	Trans. by B.DULGUUN The following is an interview with the Director of My Family Home (Manai Ger) Orphanage Center, N.Gaamaa about her orphanage. She’s been raising and caring for children since graduating from college that trains kindergarten teachers. In 2003, she co-founded My Family Home Orphanage with a Japanese citizen, Ken Aratame, and started off with six children. The children, some of whom were disabled or diagnosed with tuberculosis and heart diseases, were aged from 16-day-old to 18-months-old. The orphanage currently houses 26 healthy children, with the youngest being aged six. They temporarily housed, provided documentation and registration for schools and kindergartens, and entrusted some 80 children to their parents and relatives. Most people consider one or two children to be troublesome. Why did you choose this work to care for children? I’ve been working and providing care for children since I graduated as a kindergarten teacher. I partnered with Ken Aratame, a teacher at the Tokyo University, to research about orphans and disabled children of vulnerable groups for five years since 1998. During the research, we worked with families of vulnerable groups in Songinokhairkhan District. To extend the framework of this work, we decided to establish an orphanage. We began our operations for the orphanage after getting permission from the District’s Labor and Social Welfare Department. Our children had a very tough time when they were young. Now, they seem to have gotten on track a bit. All of them are so helpful and lovely. Do the children call you mother or teacher? Some call me Mum, and some who can’t speak well yet, and call me Amaa (a variation of Gaamaa). Are there many talented children? There are plenty. Some excel in their academic studies. Composer D.Luvsansharav used to live in our neighborhood. He claimed that one of our girls could become a singer and that girl has won gold and silver medals at singing competitions. What do the children do during summer holiday? Previously, we used to have a camp when our Japanese financer was in Mongolia. Now, I ask my relatives to let us lodge at their summer houses for few days. One or two camps are letting us stay. While others think about getting a good rest when June comes and all schools and kindergartens go on holiday, I start worrying about clothes and stationeries for September. It costs a lot to provide food and clothing for over 20 children. How do you manage? The [Songinokhairkhan District] Welfare Department gives us approximately one million MNT. It does suffice for food. Being a child in an orphanage doesn’t necessarily mean that they have to be poor and extremely unfortunate. I want them to be provided with things just like any other person, starting from clothes, food and stationeries. Our orphanage also does tailoring and sells what we produce. We have many friends, individuals, organizations and companies that support us. People give charities of 50,000 to 100,000 MNT or more, and we use it all for the children. I am getting older. I don’t think about getting awarded with gold or silver medals like other people around my age. As soon as I get some money from the welfare department, I spend it on food. Do you manage funds for clothes, housing, and school stationeries by yourself? Yes. The most problematic is rent. I was demanded to vacate this house before July 1. We’re temporarily moving to an apartment in Sansar District. When I look for a new house, I’m demanded to pay a large sum of money in advance. I’m in a difficult situation and confused about what I should do. Maybe some readers will be interested in supporting our orphanage after reading this interview. Although, we have many companies supporting and helping us out, I’m a bit hesitant about asking for more help. I myself am a bit reserved. I don’t like asking for favors. I try to do things by myself. If we can resolve housing issues, there will not be any further issues to be concerned abou	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=11281
2016 parliamentary and local election budget set at 16.4 billion MNT	By E.OYUNDARI The Standing Committee on State Structure gathered on Wednesday to discuss the official start date for the 2016 parliamentary and local election campaigns to begin, and approved a 16.4 billion MNT budget for the upcoming elections. The suggestion to issue 16.4 billion MNT from the state budget for the elections was put forward by the General Election Commission. During the standing committee meeting, Chairman of the General Authority of Registration and Statistics S.Mendsaikhan mentioned that some financing to prepare for the elections has not been resolved. He said, “The General Authority of Registration and Statistics suggested that 3.6 billion MNT was required to make the preparations. However, only 2.2 billion MNT has been allotted for the authority’s spending. “We need 277 million MNT to replace the batteries of laptops which were used in the last three elections, and 360 million MNT to buy 200 brand new laptops. Also, the spending to expand the central server will not be spent from the allotted 2.2 billion MNT.” The First Vice Head of the General Police Department J.Buyanbat noted, “Some 706.9 million MNT is required for securing the ballot paper printing process and the appointment of officials. However, any money has been issued to the police department.” The budget for the upcoming elections is 400 million MNT less than that of the 2012 elections. Head of the Cabinet Secretariat S.Bayartsogt stressed that additional expenses can be covered by the Government’s reserve fund.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19157
Food merchants and producers want state policy support	By E.OYUNDARI Food producers want the state to implement substantial policy to protect domestic food production from imports, to conduct market studies in order to export domestically-made products, and they want export taxes to be reduced. Nearly 50 representatives of food producers and traders, including APU, Talkh Chikher, Suu, Makh Market, Khuns Complex, and Darkhan Khuns, attended an open discussion on state policy on challenges facing their industry, which was organized last week by the Mongolian People’s Party (MPP) group in Parliament and the Mongolian Food Producers Association. During the open discussion, food producers spoke to parliamentarians about the vital issues that food producing companies, factories, and entities face. The attendees and organizers shared their views on the state’s support and protection of the sector as it relates to national security. Parliament and the Government of Mongolia have issued over 50 policy documents since 1999 in order to develop production in Mongolia. Even though many laws and policies are in effect, many problems still strike the food sector and domestic producers. The attendees underlined the lack of substantial state policy for the nation to become more independent from the import of food products. They also stated that they want the state to support exporters with loans and taxation policy devoted to food producers so that the industry can become more independent and replace imports. “The ministry in charge of food should create its policy to train personnel specialized in the food sector. At the moment, we need a specific outline for food industrialization, and specific research, calculations, and planning. The state will firmly support the development of production and cooperation from food producers to create more potential and high quality products,” noted MP S.Byambatsogt. The MP said that MPP authorities are initiating a light industry program and are developing a draft parliamentary resolution. School lunch programs need reform Director of Milk Company B.Gantulga highlighted that reforms are needed for lunch programs carried out in general education schools. He criticized the state’s policy, claiming that it tries to fill the pupils’ stomachs rather than feed children good-quality, healthy, and safe food in their lunch programs. He emphasized the importance of children’s health and growth and stressed that milk should be included in the lunch programs of schools and kindergartens. He cited that the average height of children in China increased by six centimeters and tooth decay in children decreased by eight times since China implemented a special program for school children providing them with good quality milk with school lunches. B.Gantulga reminded state authorities that it is time to take care of providing children with healthy nutrition. Director of Khuns Complex LLC and a member of the Board of Directors of the Mongolian Food Producer’s Association D.Oyuntuya represented meat and meat product companies at the discussion. She blamed the unregulated implementation of state policy for the increasing declarations of bankruptcy by meat producers. She explained that meat traders buy cheap meat from herders and sell it at higher prices, destabilizing the value of meat products. She also noted that food producers are under VAT pressure, and stressed that the state does not do anything even though food producers have asked many times to ease VAT. Representatives of food product companies pointed out that domestically-made cookies cost more than imported cookies. Some Russian-made cookies cost 600 MNT per kg, but domestic cookie producers make cookies that sell for a minimum of 800 to 900 MNT per kg. They explained that VAT pressure impacts the price of domestic cookies, making them more expensive than imported options. Noting that entities with income of less than 1.5 billion MNT per year receive VAT exemption when importing equipment, the attendees said that entiti	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19209
Mongolia and Russia sign mid-term program agreement to develop strategic partnership	By E.OYUNDARI Foreign Affairs Minister of the Russian Federation Sergey Viktorovich Lavrov arrived at Chinggis Khaan International Airport on Wednesday morning to conduct an official visit upon the invitation of Foreign Affairs Minister of Mongolia L.Purevsuren. As a part of the visit, the counterparts signed a mid-term program agreement for the development of a strategic partnership between Mongolia and Russia. Noting that strategic partnership relations are actively developing and the frequency of high-level talks is stabilizing, the counterparts shared views on current regional and global problems and discussed key issues of bilateral cooperation in various multilateral formats. Minister Lavrov said that the program agreement is comprehensive and geared to overcome issues concerning bilateral economic ties that have gone unresolved in recent years, to further expand cooperation in the political, trade, economic, humanitarian, and international spheres. Prime Minister Ch.Saikhanbileg also received Sergey Lavrov. Emphasizing that Mongolia-Russia relations in trade and economy have advanced in the past two years, Ch.Saikhanbileg thanked Russia for its support and contributions to the relations of two countries. “Now we have no legal obstacles to resume credit relations between Russia and Mongolia, Foreign Ministers Sergey Lavrov and L.Purevsuren signing program agreement such a possibility is currently under discussion,” Lavrov said when asked about the possibility of Russia providing loans to Mongolia. Earlier this year, Russia ratified a law to write off Mongolia’s 174 million USD debt to Russia. The debt was a major obstacle for establishing deeper cooperation between the two countries. This is the second visit by Lavrov to Mongolia, and was conducted as the nations prepare to mark the 95th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19272
Cabinet reviews results of the Hour of Solutions meetings	By E.OYUNDARI Prime Minister Ch.Saikhanbileg reviewed work that has been done as a result of the Cabinet’s weekly Hour of Solutions meetings, and decided that many efficient political and economic projects have been carried out as a result of the meetings. The PM instructed the Cabinet Secretariat to intensify efforts to resolve outstanding projects and reintroduce them in Cabinet meetings to arrive at completion. During Wednesday’s Hour of Solutions meeting, the PM said that over 100 issues have been resolved through 50 Hour of Solutions meetings held weekly since February 17, 2015. During the very first Hour of Solutions meeting, Prime Minister Ch.Saikhanbileg instructed authorities to stop using sports utility vehicles (SUVs) and large cars for the official errands of ministries, agencies, and state organizations, and demanded that state officials use smaller cars with fuel consumption of 16 liters per 100 kilometers in the city. “As a result of the meeting, state purchases of larger vehicles for over 80 million MNT have stopped, saving 20.8 billion MNT in 2015. Nearly 100 SUVs were removed from use by state bodies and distributed to the provincial and border departments of several state organizations, including the General Police Department, General Executive Agency of Court Decisions, and the General Authority of Border Protection,” noted Deputy Chairman of the State Secretariat G.Ganbold during Wednesday’s meeting.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19274
Prime Minister gives an official  statement on Mongolia’s debt	By E.OYUNDARI During Friday’s regular Parliamentary session meeting, Prime Minister Ch.Saikhanbileg gave an official statement on the current state of Mongolia’s foreign and internal debt. The PM said the statement was being made to provide accurate information to a misinformed public about the country’s debt. PM Ch.Saikhanbileg said, “Under the Law on the Government of Mongolia, the Law on State Budget, and the Law on Debt Management, the Finance Ministry has obligations to register statistical information about the government’s debt and to report on it. “In accordance with the law on the Central Bank, Mongol Bank is in charge of registering and reporting the statistics of the external sector of Mongolia, or the statistical information and debt registration of government, the private sector, and banks. “Fulfilling its obligation under the law, the Finance Ministry issues an annual report on governmental debt, and Mongol Bank hosts the registration of Mongolia’s internal and external debt registration and issues annual and quarterly reports. These reports are uploaded on the websites of Mongol Bank and the Finance Ministry and are accessible and open to the public. Therefore, I want political parties, politicians, researchers, and interested citizens to get debt information from these official sources to avoid having off-balance concepts and understanding about debt. “The World Bank annually issues a report on detailed statistical information about the world’s countries. Its last edition included statistical information about external and internal debts as of the end of 2014. “The Finance Ministry has delivered statistical information on the government’s debt as of the end of 2015 to all parliamentary members. I hope you all reviewed the official report. The report, issued from the Finance Ministry, was developed in accordance with financial registration methods offered by the International Monetary Fund. “The statistical information on Mongolia’s total debt includes direct foreign investments and loans between companies. As of the end of 2015, Mongolia’s total debt reached 21.6 billion USD, whereas 4.9 billion of it, or 22.9 percent, is debt taken on by the government. “The government does not bear any financial obligation for foreign investments and loans issued to the private sector in cases where it did not guarantee it. Government debt is debt that is repaid from the state budget or tax income. The government’s nominal debt remainder was 14.3 trillion MNT as of the end of 2015, or 12.1 trillion MNT under the present value of the principal. Equaling 52.3 percent of the GDP, it is below the debt limit in compliance with the law on budget stability. This means that the government did not violate the law and is operating under the law. “The misleading information that says every citizen of Mongolia has a debt of 15 million MNT is spreading and is creating mental stress for citizens. I believe and suspect that this is an intentional tactic to scare people as the parliamentary elections are approaching. “Some people are giving the wrong idea that citizens should pay off the country’s loans. International investors and assessment organizations pay attention to the repayment capacity of a country rather than its amount of debt. When investors make a decision to invest, they compare the government’s debt to several indicators, including GDP, export income, the government’s income, and the government’s debt service, in order to determine the country’s repayment capacity and its potential to pay off debt. “As part of the Law on Debt Management of the government, the government is aiming to implement moderate debt management, based on a strategic document on 2016 – 2018 governmental debt management, adhering to its principles: to not put massive pressure on the balance of budget and payments, to not reduce official foreign currency reserves, to keep the balance of tugrug stable, to pursue refinancing for less expense and to improve 	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19324
Mongolia-India ties strengthen with Lok Sabha Speaker’s visit	By E.OYUNDARI Speaker of the Indian Parliament’s Lower House, the Lok Sabha, Sumitra Mahajan arrived in Ulaanbaatar to attend the 9th Asia-Europe Parliamentary Partnership Meeting, and held bilateral talks with her Mongolian counterpart yesterday. Z.Enkhbold, Speaker of the Parliament of Mongolia, officially welcomed Speaker Mahajan at Chinggis Square yesterday. Shortly after the welcoming ceremony, the counterparts signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on cooperation between the State Great Khural and the Lok Sabha. Under the inter-parliamentary MoU, the legal grounds for inter-parliamentary cooperation have been strengthened, and the two nations believe that pleasant conditions are being created to expand future collaboration. The signed document is also a step toward Mongolia and India offering each other mutual support in the international and regional arenas. Beginning official talks, Speaker Z.Enkhold underlined that Speaker Mahajan’s visit was the first official visit from a high-level Indian official since the relations of two countries were upgraded to a strategic partnership at the end of 2015. Mahajan noted that relations and collaboration between the two countries have been developed and enriched in recent years with new forms of collaboration. She added that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Mongolia in 2015 was a significant event in the history of bilateral relations between Mongolia and India. “The Mongolia-India relations and cooperation, based on historical and cultural ties, on common values of democracy, on bilateral aspiration to keep regional and international peace and stability, have been intensively developing under the strategic partnership principle,” noted Z.Enkhbold. He noted that the very first visit of the Indian Prime Minister to Mongolia in 2015, conducted on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations, brought bilateral cooperation in information technology, renewable energy, industry, agriculture, culture, and education to a new stage. Speaker Z.Enkhbold pointed out that the Mongolian Foreign Affairs Minister plans to pay a visit to India later this month to sign a general credit agreement for a one billion USD soft loan granted by India, adding that Mongolian Parliament is to discuss authorization of the signing of the government’s agreement this week. Speaker Mahajan noted that one of the main policy directions of India is to support Mongolia in all spheres, noting that Mongolia is a model democracy in Asia. Mentioning Mongolia’s natural resources and India’s highly developed technology, she underlined that India and Mongolia have great cooperation opportunities if the sides collaborate to combine the countries’ resources. Noting the contribution of bilateral high-level visits in the development of cooperation between legislative bodies and bilateral relations, Speaker Z.Enkhbold stated that India’s policy to support landlocked countries such as Mongolia is significant. He added that Mongolia is working on establishing the International Think-Tank for Landlocked Developing Countries in Ulaanbaatar. He expressed Mongolia’s willingness to boost mutually beneficial and sustainable cooperation in economy and trade with India. The Speaker emphasized the importance of the Mongolia-India cooperation committee in terms of designing the framework for trade and economic collaboration, as well as its proper directions and forms, and for supporting ties between the nations’ private sectors. Speaker Z.Enkhbold congratulated India on strengthening its reputation and influence in the world and in the region, and said Mongolia wants to maintain a tradition of strengthening cooperation between the two nations within the UN and other international and regional organizations. Speaker Mahajan echoed Z.Enkhbold’s hopes for bilateral cooperation in multiple spheres, and said that India has prioritized the development of its remote regions in recent years, and noted that India’s exper	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19349

Prime Minister visits western provinces	By E.OYUNDARI Prime Minister Ch.Saikhanbileg conducted a working visit to the western provinces, meeting with officials and residents of Uvs, Khovd and Bayan-Ulgii provinces from April 21 to 23. New flight to western provinces opens doors for domestic air transportation In Khovd province, Prime Minister Ch.Saikhanbileg attended a ceremony for the arrival of the first flight of MIAT’s Boeing 737 from Ulaanbaatar to the western provinces. During the ceremony, the Prime Minister highlighted that Khovd Province should become an essential link in Mongolia’s air transportation and construction development. He stressed that he was witness to a significant event in the history of Mongolia’s civil aviation and transportation sectors. The Prime Minister noted that he expects Khovd Province’s airport to become a larger airport as a result of the launch of the large aircraft flight between Khovd and Ulaanbaatar, and added that Khovd, home to a variety of of ethnic minorities, and other western provinces should become tourist attraction centers. Minister of Roads and Transportation M.Zorigt, who accompanied the Prime Minister on his visit, emphasized that the goals of air transportation sector officials have materialized with the launch of the large aircraft flight, and added that the next phase of work is to launch flights with large airplanes to the eastern provinces. “As a part of this project, the airport of Choibalsan, Dornod Province, will be rebuilt and maintained.” Road travel from Ulaanbaatar to Khovd Province takes two days, and can cost nearly 100,000 MNT. The flight from Ulaanbaatar to Khovd takes only two hours at a cost of 200,000 MNT. Uvs Province improves housing and healthcare During his working visit to Uvs Province, the Prime Minister learned that the population of the province has reached 80,900 people over the last five years. In recent years, Uvs Province has experienced pleasant winters, resulting in the survival of healthy livestock. “As of the end of 2014, a total of 25.6 million heads of livestock were registered. One of leading sectors besides livestock herding in Uvs is farming. Uvs Province has been meeting the flour needs of the three western provinces. Also, investment in Uvs Province has doubled in the last four years,” an Uvs Province official told the visiting state delegation. Uvs has built a medical treatment and diagnosis center with 2.3 billion MNT in financing from the Prime Minister’s budget package. The number of people visiting Ulaanbaatar to undergo medical check-ups has been cut in half since the new medical center opened. The Prime Minister learned that Uvs Province has had around 70 cases of measles in the last two years, and that the spread of measles has been reduced. Uvs is successfully implementing its own Street Project, paving 10.5 kilometers of road, 14.5 kilometers of sidewalks, and 2.1 kilometers of bicycle paths, also upgrading its underground engineering network. The province built a 127 meter bridge over the Tes River at a cost of 2.9 billion MNT, which has allowed herders to migrate between their winter and spring camps with fewer barriers. As a part of the 1,000 Families Project, apartments for 646 families have been commissioned. From 1990 to 2012, residential apartments for only 98 families were available in Uvs. A waste disposal site has been cleared and repurposed with the construction of townhouses with a well for freshwater supply. Aero Mongolia and Hunnu Air conduct direct flights between Ulaanbaatar and Uvs Province six days a week, allowing tourists to make convenient travel plans, Uvs Province authorities emphasized. Bayan-Ulgii residents want a maternity hospital built During his working visit to Bayan-Ulgii, the Prime Minister learned that the birth rate in Bayan-Ulgii Province is higher than the average birth rate of the country. In 2012, 1,864 mothers gave birth at Bayan-Ulgii’s maternity hospital ward, whereas 2,108 gave birth there in 2015. Bayan-Ulgii authorities	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19435
MP S.Demberel evaluates economic development solutions	Trans. by B.DULGUUN Business and government leaders covered pressing economic issues at the annual Mongolian Economic Forum (MEF) last week and created a common ground for accelerating the development in the country. The following is an interview with Member of Parliament and head of Civil Will Green Party S.Demberel about some discussions and ideas raised at the forum and other economic issues. The Asian Development Bank evaluated that Mongolia’s current economic situation and outlook need to be improved during the MEF. It stated that Mongolia will face difficulties starting from 2017, when the sovereign bond repayment starts. Can you comment on this? Everybody is saying this. We’ve practically memorized every word. The economy is looked at through three different perspectives. The first is the perspective of producers, including people in industry, agriculture and mining sectors. The development of small and medium-sized entities can be discussed for the industrial sector. We’ve talked about this for many years and the public now has extensive knowledge about industries. This is very good. The second perspective belongs to families that review final products, as well as public and government consumption. Every economy creates savings. This perspective monitors net exports, and the difference between Mongolia’s total exports and imports. All these factors contribute to economic growth. If we look closer at household consumption, Mongolian households don’t have savings. Everyone is using their income. It’s impossible to create savings. Some banks are now talking about creating savings. To achieve this, we need to create an income source through several channels or open new stable jobs. Mongolia began receiving bond money from February 2012. Roads were built and factories received investment through loans. Yet, household income plunged rather than increasing. Savings went into negative values from late 2014. This is a problem. It’s definitely a challenge that needs a solution. We need to talk about ways to boost real household income, but no one is raising this issue. I’ve already spoken out about this so I’m hoping people would start discussing household income issues soon. Economists talked about creating a wealthy middle class. Would this be effective for preventing economic slowdown and crisis? Yes, but it all depends on internal factors. Those with poor lifestyles will get a slightly better life. The lower middle class will be raised to middle class and the middle class will try to become richer and advance to upper class. This is mankind’s inherent desire. Looking at Mongolia’s social structure, around 30 percent of the population is poor, 40 to 45 percent fit in the lower middle class, and merely some 20 percent belong to the middle class. Six to seven percent of the population fit in the upper class. We can launch the “Tsakhiur Tumur” policy, which involves confiscating livestock of the rich and distributing it to the poor. It’s a policy that opens everyone’s opportunities and supports the poor. There are similar policies, such as pawnshops. It’s a daily financial service. However, we don’t know who’s in charge of pawnshops even to this day. The Financial Regulatory Commission has been in charge of pawnshops in accordance with the one-sentenced law. Offices doing not so well these days are all rented by financial organizations. During economic difficulties, people get loans from financial businesses no matter how high their interests are because they need money. A pawnshop owner said that the annual interest rate of most pawnshops in Mongolia is 48 to 60 percent. This is internationally known as a money laundering business. Yet, Mongolia has allowed this business for over 20 years. People’s income isn’t increasing, poverty has stopped at one spot, and even the middle class is stuck at one place, unable to raise their livelihood. Financial opportunities that arise naturally haven’t been freed. This is the main cause for	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19105
Young Mongolian sumo reveals ambition and goal	Trans. by B.DULGUUN Kyokushuho T.Erdenebaatar has continuously performed well in the top division of Japanese professional sumo since his debut in 2008. The young sumo wrestler, born in 1988, has previously won juryo and jonidan division tournaments and advanced to the top division in 2012. He is a little bigger than average sumo wrestlers, with a height of 191 cm and weight of 153 kg. Just recently, he competed in the Spring Grand Sumo Tournament and was ranked fifth in the East Maegashira of the top (Makuuchi) division. Kyokushuho T.Erdenebaatar spoke about himself and his journey in becoming a professional sumo wrestler in the interview below. You were ranked fifth in the East Maegashira in the spring banzuke, rankings of professional sumo wrestlers published before each official tournament. Bazuke is said to be very important for sumo wrestlers and that they await its release in high anticipation. Did you expect yourself to be ranked so high this year? Earning a new, higher title is thrilling. On the other hand, you have no choice but to pray and hope that your rank hasn’t fallen too much after doing badly in a tournament. I had a rough idea about which rank I would reach if I won a certain number of matches last month. The ranking wouldn’t change much if all sumo wrestlers do well at the previous month’s tournament, but it changes drastically if many sumo wrestlers had skipped or performed badly. Sometimes, ranks can jump up by two ranking. In general, sumo wrestlers can guess their rank before a bazuke is published. We all await its publication in high anticipation as it shows sumo wrestlers’ hard-work and effort through scores. What does banzuke mean to you? It’s an evaluation of me and a very important document showing my status. There are four title holders or champions in my rank. I’m one of the key sumo wrestlers so I have to always stay in the front row of any reception or measure. The name of sumo wrestlers without a title are written in tiny letters, but names are written in larger fonts when they earn a title. These types of small differentiation and changes influence on the mentality of sumo wrestlers a lot. It gives joy and happiness to us. I actually keep all of these banzuke documents. Before the opening of sumo tournaments, you have been performing the ring-entering ceremony for purifying the arena along with Yokozuna Hakuho M.Davaajargal and Brazilian-born Maegashira Kaisei Ichiro. How does it feel to perform such an honorable ceremony? Only sumo wrestlers in the makuuchi division can perform this ceremony. In the previous spring tournament, I assisted Yokozuna Hakuho M.Davaajargal as the tsuyuharai, dew sweeper, but this time, I was the tachimochi, sword carrier. Only high-ranking sumo wrestlers are able to become the sword carrier. I have to hold the sword for 15 days of the tournament and it feels splendid. I think I said that I wanted to quickly enter the top division and perform the ring-entering ceremony in my first interview after entering the juryo division. I’m very proud of myself for being able to participate for so long in this ceremony at the beginning of every tournament day. Before, Kyokutenho N.Tsevegnyam participated in the ring-entering ceremony for many years. Maegashira Kaisei Ichiro is a strong sumo wrestler in the same stable as you. What do you think about him? Kaisei used to belong to the Tomozuna Stable. We became part of the same stable, Oshima Stable, when our coach Oshima retired. We used to be opponents before, but now, we are quite close since we’re both foreign sumo wrestlers. He started training in sumo two years before me. We got along well from the start because we were both far from home and share the same heartache. Japanese sumo wrestlers hardly feel home-sick because they can go visit their family anytime. Famous Mongolian former sumo wrestlers, including Kyokushuzan D.Batbayar and Kyokutenho N.Tsevegnyam, used to train at the Tomozuna Stable.

Roberto Salvalaio:  Conducting the state morin khuur ensemble was my dream	Trans. by B.DULGUUN This particular foreign music conductor has a long history with Mongolian artists and the Mongolian State Academic Theater of Opera and Dance (SATOD). The public has heard his name so many times in the last six years that they even wonder he might have Mongolian ancestry. He has collaborated with some of the best orchestras in the world, including the Venice Symphony Orchestra, the Transilvania State Philharmonic Orchestra of Cluj Napoca, the State Philharmonic of Bacau, the Caracas National Symphony Orchestra, the Russian State Symphony Orchestra, the Symphony Orchestra in Catania, the State Philharmonic of Ploiesti, the State Philharmonic of Arad, the Mediterranean Symphony Orchestra and more. Yet, he still returns to Mongolia. This person is none other than world-recognized Italian conductor Roberto Salvalaio. He has been a musical director of the SATOD since 2010 In the last three months, Salvalaio has been working in Ulaanbaatar at the invitation of the SATOD. He recently began his collaboration with the State Morin Khuur Ensemble and participated in Playing Love IV Concert of State Honored composer N.Jantsannorov. Now, he’s preparing to conduct Novel Melody Chamber Music Concert on April 16. The following is an interview with Salvalaio, who has rendered countless music pieces, from the best classical pieces to traditional Mongolian music, about his latest work and his experience working in Mongolia. You conducted the State Morin Khuur Ensemble at Playing Love IV Concert last month. Tell us about the experience? I first came to Mongolia in 2010. Since then, I have always dreamed of conducting the State Morin Khuur Ensemble at least once. This type of orchestra only exists in Mongolia. I got a chance to conduct the State Morin Khuur Orchestra this time because the ensemble’s conductor invited me. Most of the pieces were pieces conducted by Italian composer Ennio Morricone, as well as French and European composers, so it wasn’t that difficult. What influences you the most in accepting invitations from Mongolian artists and organizations? What makes you always return to Mongolia? In the past, I used to come to Mongolia for only short periods of times like seven to 10 days, but this time, I stayed and worked here for three whole months. I’m always happy when collaborating with the SATOD. It’s an amazing theater with extremely talented artists. Being able to preserve its tradition, culture and heritage despite being situated between two large states is what makes Mongolia different and unique. Mongolia’s music and taste are completely different from their neighboring countries’. Each and every person has a musical taste. I take a taxi every day. I’ve met couple of drivers who sing while taking me to my destination. In my opinion, they sing very well. Is conducting Mongolian compositions different from conducting European compositions? I used to be a composer before becoming a conductor. At the time, my instructor told me that there were two types of music. First one is good music and the other is not so good music. I’ve never actually categorized music as classical, jazz, traditions and other. How musicians play their instruments and how the maestro conducts to deliver the composer’s composition are what matters most. I feel and understand music by Italian composers better. On the other hand, I need experience to understand the music of Mongolian musicians. I conducted “Munkh Tengeriin Khuchin Dor” (Under the Powers of the Everlasting Heavens) film music piece by N.Jantsannorov during Playing Love IV Concert. I wouldn’t say it’s difficult, but it felt different. But the images on screen helped a lot because a film music is played based on events and scenes. Which is harder: composing or conducting? A famous composer once said in a TV talk show that anyone can lead and conduct an orchestra. Composing music is difficult, so is playing music. Also, if a musician doesn’t have his instrument, he can’t do anythi	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19174
MP Ts.Oyungerel highlights changes needed in public attitude for increasing women’s political leadership	Trans. by B.DULGUUN The National Forum on Women’s Participation at Decision-Making Level, which took place at the Central Cultural Palace last Monday, covered important topics related to women’s political leadership and participation, gender equality in politics, and roles of female MPs in the society. The forum was co-organized by the Women’s Caucus in Parliament, International Republican Institute and Parliamentary Office of Mongolia. MP Ts.Oyungerel spoke about the forum, current situation of women’s participation at decision-making level in Mongolia and related international practices in the interview below. A conference was held on women’s participation at decision-making level last Monday. Mongolia’s representation of women in Parliament was ranked 98th out of 190 countries, which was deemed inadequate. What’s the reason for this low ranking? Women have been achieving success at every sector. Mongolian women are leading global rankings in education, health, legal, and engineering sectors. Mongolia has been ranked low at 98th only for women’s political participation. The fact that Mongolian women, who have high intellectual potential to lead industries, have been ranked below some countries with the lowest literacy rate in the world is definitely connected to the legal environment. Mongolia established electoral quotas for women very late during the 2012 election. This is 20 years behind Latin American practices and compared to European practices, it’s 50 years behind. On the other hand, we can observe that voters don’t recognize the need of women’s representation at parliamentary level because it’s inconsistent to their attitude and education. Voters’ education level is very high. Mongolia is one of the leading countries in terms of its literacy rate, education level, ability to receive information, and information accessibility. We have access to a lot of information and yet, [votes for female candidates] are low because the information provided to voters isn’t helping female politicians. If this is changed, it’s fully possible to vote for every female candidate. You led the sub-forum for women’s participation at provincial decision-making level. Provincial representatives mentioned at the forum that people aren’t very supportive of women’s representation at local administrative level and continue to ignore this matter. Can you comment on this? This sort of thing was talked a lot. N.Narantuya, who gave a speech representing Khovd Province raised issues concerning women’s representation in western regions. Uvs and Bayan-Ulgii Province are doing poorly in terms of women’s participation. The same goes for Khovd Province. Zavkhan is doing slightly better than other western provinces. The Law on Promotion of Gender Equality must specify quotas for provincial divisions of Mayor’s Offices and among provincial mayors. That quota is specified as 40 percent in the law, but there’s only one female representative in Bayan-Ulgii and Uvs Provinces. No one is supervising this. The National Audit Office doesn’t inspect the fulfillment of the Law on Promotion of Gender Equality during regular inspections. Opportunities for women’s participation at decision-making level is scarce in provinces because the ratio of men and women assigned to important positions isn’t monitored. It can be said that regular inspection rounds of the National Audit Office, which controls implementations of laws, is poor. Head of the Democratic Women’s Association (DWA) S.Odontuya and head of the Mongolian Social Democratic Women’s Association Ts.Tsogzolmaa gave an interesting speech on pressing issues for women’s organizations under political parties. You managed the women’s wing of the Democratic Party (DP) and DWA for five years. What kind of difficulties and challenges did you face? We couldn’t resolve two big challenges for a long time. Making DP leaders of all levels realize, understand and recognize that it’s possible to nominate female members was a hug	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19218
Mongolian hairdresser displays true artistry at OMC Hairworld 2016	Trans. by B.DULGUUN A Mongolian team of hairdressers recently competed in the World Hairdressing Championships: OMC Hairworld 2016, which took place from March 27 to 29 in Seoul, South Korea. Over 1,600 participants from 50 nations competed on the opulent Korean stage. Mongolian hairdressers excelled in the Senior Gents Creative category, in which S.Munkhnasan won a gold medal, N.Altanshagai came in fourth place, and G.Gantsooj placed ninth. The Mongolian team ranked third in the Senior Gents Technical Team competition and the Ladies Aesthetics Team competition, and placed seventh in the Senior Ladies Fashion category. The following is an interview with the head of the Mongolian Association of Hairdressers and Cosmetologists (MAHC) and master hairdresser of Sky Salon, D.Odkhuu, about the OMC Hairworld 2016. Congratulations for getting a world champion hairdresser from your association. How big was the scale of this year’s OMC Hairworld? How many Mongolian hairdressers and cosmetologists took part in the event? This year is the 70th anniversary of the Organization Mondiale Coiffure (OMC), the largest professional hairstylists’ organization in the world. Mongolia joined the organization during its 60th anniversary, but it’s the 35th time we’re competing in the OMC Hairworld. A Mongolian hairdresser became a champion this year in the Senior Gents Creative category. That person is S.Munkhnasan, the master hairdresser at Vidal Salon. Director of Khos Shagai Salon N.Altanshagai came in fourth place and our male hairdressers’ team came in third in another category. Not only hairdressers but also cosmetologists participate in this competition. We had a relatively big team because it was hosted in the Republic of Korea and the expenses were more reasonable. In total, 34 Mongolians competed. We took along our models for better performance. Our hairdressers won Grand Prix and became champions of Asian and European competitions before. I’m very happy that one of them became a world champion this time. This is probably the result of 10 years of continuous participation in various competitions. Can you share your personal achievements as a hairdresser? I became an Asian champion in the men’s hairdressing category. Since 2009, I’ve been working as a judge and coach. I was one of the judges at the OMC Hairworld 2016. It isn’t easy judging 180 to 200 hair styles a day. I still had to try hard because an internationally renowned competition chose me as a judge. I’ve been leading the Mongolian team in the last six years. The state provides financial support to athletes and artists competing in international competitions. It also rewards them if they make an achievement. What kind of support did your team receive? All three million Mongolians celebrate when a world champion is born from sports, arts and cultural sectors, but not for champions of specialized occupations. Probably only the media are interested in hairdresser and cosmetologist champions. The state doesn’t give us any support. We pay for our expenses whenever we take part in a competition. Our sector fell after Mongolia’s transition to a free market economy in the 1990s. The state doesn’t regulate or support our sector at all. So we founded the MAHC in 2006 in hopes to unite hairdressers and cosmetologists. The participation fee alone costs 800 USD. It costs 200 to 300 USD per mannequin head used at the competition so there are many difficulties. Each person spends a minimum of seven to eight million MNT. Even so, we participate in various competitions at our own cost and with encouragement from customers. A government resolution for rewarding hairdressers and cosmetologists who make special achievements at regional and international competitions was passed in August 2012. It specifies that 40 million MNT will be granted to world champions and 20 million MNT for regional champions, but our Asian and European champions weren’t rewarded because the money wasn’t allocated in the state 	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19247
Mongolia takes big strides towards eco-friendly society	Trans. by B.DULGUUN The following is an interview with general coordinator of the Organic Mongolia Program D.Onon about the program and environmental concerns in Mongolia. Can you tell us why the Organic Mongolia Program was initiated? The Organic Mongolia Program was launched in 2009 at the initiative of the Mongolian National Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The program is beneficial to the whole society and contributes to Mongolia’s green development, the future development trend. It is proceeding successfully thanks to the participation and support of many organizations. The concept and approach to digging up underground resources and using its profit to improve the lives of the public is only temporary. What’s more important than this is becoming environmentally friendly, developing agricultural production, and establishing an independent food security in Mongolia. We can live without the luxury of brand clothes, big houses, and expensive cars, but we can’t live without food, clean air and water. We shouldn’t forget the foundation and most crucial sectors of Mongolia, which are agriculture and environment. The ultimate goal of all this effort is protection of the future of our children. The program has been running for nearly seven years. Have you achieved what you wanted? Has the program shown any results? During this time, our program team has helped many people by executing the Organic Mongolia micro-credit program. This sub-program was first started to provide flexible financial conditions and opportunities to small and medium-sized enterprises, family businesses and provincial brand producers working in the agricultural sector. As a result, people in the agricultural sector have begun to trust banks. Now, all banks are focusing on stabilizing and financially supporting the agricultural sector. Banks have joined hands to develop the TOS Program as part of the policy to support lenders in the eco-friendly sector. Large international projects and programs have opened opportunities for Mongolia to generate capital for developing organic brand products and eco factories. I believe that our efforts have contributed to this at least a little. The micro-credit program’s funding is like a drop of water compared to other projects’ financing. Even so, we’ve improved the livelihoods of more than 5,000 people and implemented over 600 projects through the Organic Mongolia micro-credit program. This is a huge achievement. Future works will be aimed to increase organic food usage and eliminate food dependency. In relation, we’re undertaking all kinds of green initiatives, including green office, environment, education, habit, green residents, micro-districts and families. How much financing is provided to people and what is the criteria for the financing? Do you monitor if the financing has reached its designated owner? Our micro-credit loan fund amounts to 550 million MNT. Our monthly budget is less than five million MNT, but we complete double the amount of work other programs and projects do. For instance, international organizations allocate over 20 million MNT for a car’s annual expense. Depending on the number of projects competing for a tender, we decide the number of people we will issue loans. We tell whether a project is supported or not on the spot to ensure fair and transparent selection process. The most important criteria is that the business is eco-friendly and operates properly. Although our program has the same motive as other projects and programs implemented by the state, we strive to aid the correct people at the correct time. Honestly, I doubt that the public will see much results if we wait for the state to take action. We must learn to use the opportunities and conditions we have. The main flaw in the current society is that a lot of capital is spent on sectors that waste money rather than the ones that earn money. Many countries around the globe are regretting their reckless activities and conducts that har	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19281
L.Amgalan calls for change in state policy for gender-based issues	Trans. by B.DULGUUN Women and girls continue to suffer gender-based discrimination and violence in every corner of the world and work fields despite global efforts to provide equal opportunities for both women and men, as well as to integrate gender equality into policies and practices. Mongolia is no exception. Although improvements have been noted in gender equality in Mongolia, gender-based issues are still a pressing issue in society, where patriarchy is dominant and men hold more power than women. To address this issue, the Social Democracy-Mongolian Women’s Association (SDMWA) of the Mongolian People’s Party is planning to host the Socialist International Women’s Regional Meeting for the first time in Ulaanbaatar from April 22 to 23. The general theme of the meeting will be “Woman and Asia – Promoting Gender Equality” and will mainly focus on promoting gender equality, combating all forms of discrimination against women, empowering women and girls in all fields, and initiating programs to address gender-based discrimination. Member of the organizing body, the SDMWA, and representative of the Bayangol District Council L.Amgalan spoke about the upcoming Socialist International Women’s Regional Meeting in the interview below. She’s also the executive director of Emegteichuud Khugjliin Temuulel San (Women’s Development and Aspiration Fund) NGO. Mongolia will organize its first-ever Socialist International Women’s Regional Meeting soon. Can you tell us how the SDMWA was able to get the approval to organize this meeting? This was not achieved by the SDMWA alone. Efforts of every Mongolian woman should be credited in attaining the privilege to host the Socialist International Women’s Regional Meeting. Not every nation is able to host a meeting on a regional scale. The SDMWA is the leading association for promoting gender equality in Mongolia. The association’s reputation and position among Asian countries can be seen from this achievement. The regional meeting will take place before the 11th ASEM Summit of Heads of State and Government. Representatives from how many countries will attend the event? What do you think will be achieved through the meeting? Over 30 representatives from more than 10 countries have been registered to date, including former and current MPs. The meeting is anticipated by many women across the globe, and this time, Asian female representatives will seek solutions for gender-based concerns, share experiences and practices, and our association will be able to promote its operations. Mongolia had a socialist society for 70 years in the past, but some Asian countries that will take part in the upcoming meeting haven’t experienced socialism before. These countries have been running under democratic principles and now, they’re seeking a new development path due to large gaps between the rich and poor in these countries. The Socialist International Women was established by merging positive sides of democracy and socialism after assessing international practices. This organization wants to exchange experience with the SDMWA because Mongolia has experienced both democracy and socialism. They believe that Mongolia is relatively well-experienced and is developing rapidly compared to other Asian countries. How will the upcoming meeting promote Mongolia internationally? It can be said that Mongolia has actively raised gender-based issues and made progress quite fast compared to some Asian countries. During Mongolia’s 20 years of democracy, women’s election rights were legalized and gender quotas, specifying that 30 percent of government and Parliament seats must be occupied by women, were approved. This is a huge improvement. Some nations had to fight for 50 to 100 years to achieve this. Mongolia has experienced both socialism and democracy before. Now, it’s advancing forward with the political ideology that advocates the combination of democracy and socialism. Mongolian women are leading successful careers in ever	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19333
Mongolia needs vision and accurate policy for recovering economy, says Deputy Speaker of Parliament	Trans. by B.DULGUUN The following interview with Deputy Speaker of Parliament and Head of the Mongolian People’s Party (MPP) M.Enkhbold covers timely issues in the Mongolian political world. What kind of issues do you wish to discuss and resolve at the last meeting of the current Parliament? It’s not the time to talk about what kind of issue Parliament should discuss. It’s the time to make a comprehensive evaluation of the past four years and look towards the future. We must now put an end to the crisis in the Mongolia society, economy and politics. Unless these crises are settled, it’ll lead to default and Mongolia will have no choice but to announce bankruptcy. We must contemplate why the economy, which amazed the whole world with its incredibly fast growth only four years ago, has ended to its current state. Whether it is its location, population or natural resources, Mongolia has advantages for developing a free market society. Yet, Mongolia is caught up in debt, the public is discontent, and the governance is facing a crisis. This is an unhealthy phenomenon. I’m not talking about these things as the head of the opposition party. Everyone can see that the society is facing challenges and adverse scenes. The state’s operations have faced serious failures, the public has lost faith in the state, and the economy is in a very bad shape. We have lost four whole years because of thoughtless politicians. I hope that the upcoming election will be conducted ethically and responsibly. In general, voters should change the way they look and evaluate politicians and change their voting criteria. The MPP demanded to dismiss Speaker of Parliament Z.Enkhbold, Head of the Democratic Party. Some say that it’s a political show. Is it important to dismiss the Speaker of Parliament when the election is due in less than two months? Parliament is the state supreme body of Mongolia. The public elects members of Parliament as their representative. Our party can’t accept a speaker who treats everything from the political perspective, mistreats or is rude to other MPs elected by the public and fulfills his role politically. Two months are a long time. There are many things we have to resolve without losing a single day. Yet, the Speaker of Parliament announced an irregular meeting to discuss the burial of nuclear waste. I’m sure that the public is aware that [our party] took this measure because unreasonable and unforgivable mistakes have been made repeatedly. In fact, being a Speaker of Parliament isn’t a personal issue. The Mongolian state has three major mistakes that need to be fixed that are more important than the economic difficulty. Firstly, the reputation of the Mongolian state has degraded. The public’s confidence in the state has dropped and the immunity of state officials have weakened. Secondly, Mongolia’s reputation has fallen tremendously during this era of economic globalization. Mongolia, which has a rich history of statehood, has lost the confidence of investors, starting from Russian and Chinese investors, because of reckless mistakes by few immature people. Thirdly, the most concerning issues are the fact that the Constitutional Court, the sole protector and representative of the Constitution, made an illegal, dirty decision which had a political motive. It’s impossible to forgive this act of prioritizing political interests. The parliamentary election will begin in less than two months. How is the MPP preparing for the election? More than preparing for the election, our party is mainly focusing on recovering the nation from its dire situation. Many working groups have been established and are working well. The election will proceed as planned and life will continue just like it always does. The cycle for state changeover is approaching. The MPP is preparing for it by upholding a policy to support young personnel. Also, we’re concentrating on the political education of young people. Responsibility, integrity and ethics will beco	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19369
Public urination and spitting to warrant 20,000 MNT fine	Trans. by B.DULGUUN The revised Law on Hygiene became effective on February 29, 2016. The public attention has been drawn to a particular provision in the law, which states, “If caught spitting, disposing nasal discharge or urinating on the street or public area, a 20,000 MNT penalty will be charged”. Although the law has taken effect, these conducts are still being carried out as the law’s enforcement hasn’t been carried out effectively. Officer Sh.Urantssetseg in charge of the Department of Environmental Health Policy Implementation and Coordination at the Ministry of Health and Sports was interviewed about the effectiveness of the revised Law on Hygiene and whether noticeable results were seen in the two months the law has been effective. Although the Law on Hygiene has been put into effect, associated regulations haven’t been passed. When will they be developed and officially start implementation? The Law on Hygiene became effective throughout Mongolia on February 29. At the moment, the nation is awaiting the law’s regulations to become ready. Documents have been sent to all organizations required to participate in the development of regulations. Currently, a list of over 20 regulations and rules has been made. Thirty percent of necessary regulations have been completed. A draft bill has been made for the first seven to eight regulations. Once all regulations are ready, they will be discussed at a national health research conference, which has been scheduled on May 25 and 26. Afterwards, we’ll proceed to approving the regulations Our department has sent documents related to the Law on Hygiene to the General Agency of Specialized Inspection as well as provincial and district mayors’ offices. In other words, the documents specify important provisions for mayors and their rights and responsibilities. Secondly, documents have been sent to specialized agencies and entities to introduce prohibitions in the law and ensure that they are followed. Has the law shown any results in the last two months? Yes. Outhouses in ger areas will be supervised according to the Law on Hygiene. Within this framework, the standard on outhouses was renewed and are being inforced at national level since February 1, 2016. The old standard only allowed one type of outhouse. As people’s consumption have changed, the types of toilets they use have also changed. Four different types of toilets have been standardized, specifically pit latrine, dry, bio and low-water maintenance outhouses. Districts, soums and khoroo authorities have been given information related to the regulation. Do households in ger areas have to change their toilets to meet the new standard? They will not be demanded to immediately change their toilets. They will have to gradually make their toilets consistent to the standard in stages. Once pit latrines of households become full, they have to disinfect and bury old pit latrines and choose a new one from the four types of outhouses specified in the standard. Households can postpone this work until their current pit latrines become full. But they are required to change their outhouses when it becomes full to meet standards. People who spit or urinate in public should be fined according to the law but it isn’t happening because there isn’t a regulation for the new Law on Hygiene. Shouldn’t these conducts be controlled from the day the law becomes effective? The Law on Hygiene has been effective during all this time. The provision stating that a penalty will be imposed on those who spit, dispose nasal discharge, urinate or release anything that pollutes the air in public has been implemented since February 29. Is it true that the Law on Hygiene prohibits nine things? What kind of provisions are they? The law prohibits public disposal of nasal discharge, spitting, urination, and leaving pets’ excretion on streets or public areas. Selling secondary raw material that harm people’s health near public property, area or residence is banned. It	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19412
Development Bank CEO speaks about road financing	Trans. by B.DULGUUN Meat is supplied to the capital from three eastern provinces of Mongolia. It used to take two months for three hired shepherds to collect 600 sheep from eastern provinces and bring them to Ulaanbaatar. It’s reported that the total cost of transportation amounted to 20 million MNT within the span of two months. Now, it’s become possible to transport 600 sheep to the capital within a day by truck thanks to a new road connecting Ulaanbaatar with Sukhbaatar, Dornod and Khentii Provinces. The total expense has dropped to four million MNT, according to a company that exports canned meat to Russia. CEO of the Development Bank of Mongolia N.Munkhbat gave an interview about the economic benefits of new roads. How much was invested for constructing roads connecting Ulaanbaatar and eastern provinces? Many people complain that investments are recovered for a long time and that the majority of bond investments were spent on road constructions. Can you comment on this? During the four years since the establishment of the Development Bank, our bank has been actively financing development projects. The total amount of financing has exceeded five trillion MNT. The Development Bank primarily invests in three directions. One of them is infrastructure. Hard infrastructure is essential for a nation. Around 1.4 trillion MNT has been spent on road projects, Street Project, and Ulaanbaatar’s engineering infrastructure, networks and cable lines. Hard infrastructure is unique because it isn’t a business activity. Its economic benefit is shown indirectly. This type of investment takes 28 percent of the total portfolio. The remaining 72 percent is spent on financing projects of government and non-government organizations that will give off profit to some extent. The private sector’s projects are financed through commerce banks. Our bank is also investing in large projects for the Third and Fourth Thermal Power Plants, Amgalan Thermal Power Plant, three cement and metallurgical plants, MIAT Mongolian Airlines’ Boeing 767-300ER aircraft, and the Tavan Tolgoi project. It’s become clear that engineering infrastructure and Street Project are economically beneficial, but the public is unsure whether road projects are beneficial. The Ministry of Roads and Transportation has researched and made calculations on this. Our bank made estimations using economic calculations of professors of the National University of Mongolia. Overall, the Development Bank is striving to connect all provinces to the capital via asphalt roads. Ulaanbaatar was connected to five provincial centers with asphalt roads from 1992 to 2012. In the last three years, another six provincial centers got new roads, namely provincial centers of Murun, Dundgovi, Umnugovi, Bayankhongor, Sukhbaatar and Dornod Provinces. The government constructed another road from Saishand soum of Dornogovi Province with a different investment source. Projects have started for constructing roads to western provinces. So in two years’ time, we’ll become ready to construct roads from Ulaanbaatar to Uvs, Govi-Altai, Zavkhan and Khovd Provinces. Documents and planning have finished. Only Ulgii, the center of Bayan-Ulgii Province, will be left afterwards. Generally, Mongolia will be able to develop a road network linking every part of the country. These projects will tremendously impact the Mongolian economy both directly and indirectly. We’re now linking large regions that weren’t connected to the market before. All the road work mentioned before cost 946.7 billion MNT. Over 1.2 trillion MNT has been put down into the state budget and is being issued to contractors after reviewing their performance. This figure is equal to 19 percent of the total portfolio of five trillion MNT. So 19 percent of the bond investment was spent on road construction. Yet, the economy of six provinces have been integrated with this amount of money. In addition, half of the work for joining four provincial centers to Ulaanba	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19443

Wrestlers from Finland and Latvia arrive in Mongolia to hold joint training	By B.BAATAR Finnish silver medalist of the 2015 World Wrestling Championships Petra Olli and Latvian bronze medalist of the 2015 World Wrestling Championships Anastasia Grigorieva came to Mongolia to attend a joint training with Mongolian national women’s wrestling team for 14 days. Finnish national women’s team coach Ahto Raska and the team’s masseur are accompanying the athletes. Ahto Raska said, “This is our first time in Mongolia. We met in Moscow and took a flight to Ulaanbaatar. I am very surprised that Mongolian wrestlers and wrestling enthusiasts know Anastasia Grigorieva and Petra Olli. They won Olympic quotas from the 2015 World Wrestling Championships. Anastasia Grigorieva is preparing to compete for her second Olympic Games. She is the main opponent of Mongolian world champion S.Battsetseg. I have been working as a coach for the Finnish national team for eight years. I know Mongolian coaches are good, for example Z.Duvchin and B.Batbayar. “Petra Olli competed in the 2015 World Wrestling Championships and won an Olympic quota with a silver medal. In the final, she faces Japanese Olympic and world champion Kaori Icho. She lost to Kaori Icho and won silver. I wish luck to the Mongolian national women’s team.” Anastasia Grigorieva said, “I have been training in wrestling since I was 16 years old. There are so many talented and skilled wrestlers in the women’s 63 kg category. Mongolia’s S.Battsetseg is my biggest opponent. At the London 2012 Olympic Games, I lost to S.Battsetseg. We faced five times. I got two wins and S.Battsetseg got three wins. I haven’t wrestled any Mongolian wrestler yet, except S.Battsetseg.”	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19143
Parliament demands report on 100-day economic plan	The official working group of the MPP in the parliament sent an official letter to the Ministry of Economic Development and Mongol Bank regarding the 100-day plan for economic growth implemented by the government. In the letter, five main issues were raised.

Mongolia wins its first taekwondo Olympic qualification	By B.TUNGALAG Aldar Sports Committee athlete P.Temuujin, 22, became the first Mongolian to win an Olympic quota for taekwondo at the Asian Taekwondo Qualification Tournament for Rio 2016 Olympic Games, which took place on April 16 and 17 in Pasay, Philippines. He has won a silver medal in the men’s -68kg category of the Asian Taekwondo Olympic Qualification Tournament. In the bronze medal match, he defeated silver and bronze medalist of the Olympics Rohullah Nikpai of Afghanistan. In the Olympic quota match, he beat Chang Cheng-hao of Taiwan 12:7. P.Temuujin lost the final to Ahmad Abu-Ghaush from Jordan 2:14. The top two athletes from each weight category of the tournament won Olympic quotas. Member of the Executive Committee of the Mongolian Taekwondo Federation J.Aldarbayar promised to give a 10 million MNT prize to P.Temuujin. P.Temuujin gave a brief interview to Eagle.mn. Congratulations on winning the first Olympic quota of Mongolia in taekwondo. Thank you. I am very happy. I understand now that we can see the results of our work if we try hard. I want to express my gratitude to the president of the Mongolian National Olympic Committee D.Zagdsuren, secretary-general J.Otgontsagaan, head of the Physical Training and Development Center D.Jargalsaikhan, head of the Mongolian national taekwondo team Ch.Erdenetuya, Aldar Sports Committee, president of the Mongolian Taekwondo Federation D.Enkhbat, coach N.Erdenebaatar, and my family for supporting me. What were you thinking about when you won the Olympic quota? I was very thankful to my teammates and family. I am also proud that I was born in Mongolia. I couldn’t reach this success without the Mongolian Taekwondo Federation, athletes and coaches. I shouted, “I did it”, when I won the Olympic quota. I couldn’t believe it for a while. I thought, “Did I really win it?” The Olympic Qualification Tournament is one of the hardest tournaments, because there is only one taekwondo tournament for Olympic quota. For example, there are a series of Olympic qualification tournaments of judo, wrestling and boxing. I am very excited. To whom did you tell this wonderful news first? I wanted to tell my mother, but the Mongolian Taekwondo Federation delivered this news to my mother before me. My mother said, “Thank you for telling me. It is very good news. I am very proud of my son.” I haven’t contacted my parents yet. Of course you competed in the tournament with the goal to win an Olympic quota. How confident were you? My preparation was very good and I was very confident that I would win an Olympic quota. I couldn’t have reached this success if I didn’t believe in myself. Before the Olympic quota match, I said to myself that I have to win no matter what. My strategy was to tire my opponent. In the bronze medal match, you fought against silver and bronze medalist of the Olympics Rohullah Nikpai of Afghanistan. Did you feel nervous before the match? I didn’t feel nervous because I knew that I would fight against him after the draw. Rohullah Nikpai was very nervous. I felt more confident after seeing him. You lost to Ahmad Abu-Ghaush from Jordan for the gold medal. Did you feel relieved after winning the silver medal match? Do you regret not winning the final? I took a breath after winning the silver medal. I lost to Ahmad because I used a wrong technique. At that time, I regretted it badly because I had a chance to become a champion of the tournament and win an Olympic quota. Now I am fine. I am very happy that I won an Olympic quota.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19372

Monos fails state inspection	Following the hospitalization of 16 children provided with excessive dosages of phenobarbital distributed at a Monos pharmacy, the nation’s largest pharmaceutical chain failed an inspection by the State Specialized Inspection Agency. “We are officially to blame for the affected children and we have failed to do our job responsibly,” reported Monos in a statement to the press on Tuesday. Monos commented, “The medicine, phenobarbital, has been produced for over 50 years by Emiin Uildver LLC, and the pharmacist who compounded the medicine had one year of experience at Monos and passed the pharmacology license examination in 2013.” The UB Post visited Monos Group but they refused an interview. A pharmacist from Monos said that the State Specialized Inspection Agency and the Authority for Fair Competition and Consumer Protection of Mongolia are conducting inspections at all branches of Monos, but the Monos pharmacies are conducting normal operations. The Authority for Fair Competition and Consumer Protection of Mongolia inspected branches at Tavan Shar and Sonsgolon. Some violations were discovered including the absence of a branch manager at one location, failure to label the cost of medications, the absence of instructions for use of medications, and pharmacists without professional certificates. They were also cited for selling non-health related products and toys. They products were gathered and confiscated. All 18 branches of Monos will be inspected according to the Law on Competition. The State Specialized Inspection Authority is still conducting its inspection, so the Authority for Fair Competition and Consumer Protection has not allowed the closure of its branches at Tavan Shar and Sonsgolon.

Ts.Namuuntsetseg and O.Burmaa misses their chances for Olympic qualifications	By B.TUNGALAG The first Olympic Games World Qualifying Tournament to Rio 2016 in freestyle wrestling was held at Buyant-Ukhaa Sports Palace in Ulaanbaatar from April 22 to 24. More than 500 wrestlers from 80 countries competed for Olympic quotas. From Mongolia, Asian champion D.Khuderbulga (men’s 97 kg), International Sports Master Ts.Namuuntsetseg (women’s 48 kg), and State Honored Athlete O.Burmaa (women’s 75 kg) competed in the tournament for Olympic quotas. On April 23, Ts.Namuutsetseg and O.Burmaa lost to their opponents, and were not able to win Olympic quotas. During the tournament, senior coach of the Mongolian national women’s wrestling team and State Honored Coach B.Batbayar gave an interview to Eagle.mn. You believed that Ts.Namuuntsetseg and O.Burmaa would win Olympic quotas. What do you think about their performance? Mongolian wrestlers except Ts.Namuuntsetseg, O.Burmaa and D.Khuderbulga have won Olympic qualification in every weight category. We competed in this tournament with a purpose to take Olympic quotas, but we didn’t fulfill our goal. I think Ts.Namuuntsetseg and O.Burmaa tried their best. O.Burmaa made a technical error. But I don’t blame her. For Ts.Namuuntsetseg, she has lack of experience from international tournaments. She has a chance to become an Olympic and world champion if she improves her skills and technique. The Olympic qualification tournament is taking place in Mongolia for the first time. Do you think that Mongolian athletes were psychologically well prepared because the tournament is taking place in their home country? Yes, they were. Everything was on our side. Unfortunately, we didn’t use that chance. I want to apologize to all Mongolians who love freestyle wrestling. At the tournament, O.Burmaa competed against silver and bronze medalist of the World Championship Ekaterina Bukina. I think they competed against each other several times before? They wrestled against each other four times. O.Burmaa defeated her once. Bukina has been beating her after that time. Bukina gets tired at the end of the event. O.Burmaa was trying to get her tired. But she lost. State Honored Athlete O.Burmaa got a shoulder injury last year. Do you think that the injury might have affected her at this tournament? Her injury has healed. She had a very risky surgery. I am glad she is well now. O.Burmaa is becoming powerful again; she has been gaining momentum since the National Wrestling Championship and Mongolia Open international tournament. How did you choose the team for the Olympic Games World Qualifying Tournament to Rio 2016? We chose athletes through the decision of the coaches’ council. We had a plan to let Ts.Namuutsetseg compete in the Asian Olympic Games Qualifying Tournament, which was held in Astana, Kazakhstan in March. Coach Ts.Bayarsaikhan advised Ts.Namuuntsetseg to skip that tournament. The second Olympic Games World Qualifying Tournament will be held in Istanbul, Turkey from May 6 to 8. Who will compete in the last Olympic qualification tournament? We haven’t decided yet. We review wrestlers’ skills, technique and achievements from international tournaments and training. We will select the team after review.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19447

33.4 km railway opens from Tumurtei mine to Khandgait Station	By B.DULGUUN During a visit to Selenge Province, Speaker of Parliament Z.Enkhbold attended the opening ceremony for a 33.4 km railway from Tumurtei mine to Khandgait Station in Khuder soum on April 3.. The railway was recently transferred to state-owned Mongolian Railway JSC (MTZ), along with its station for loading and unloading freight, under a government resolution issued on February 1, 2016. Qualified Mining Consultants LLC established a concessional agreement with the government and built the railway as part of a subproject aimed at resolving transportation issues. The railway will provide quicker transportation of raw materials from a direct-reduced iron plant to be built adjacent to the Darkhan Metallurgical Plant. The the 33.4 km-long railway was built as part of a complex with three terminals, as well as railway crossings and stations fully equipped with the latest technology and railway signals. It was completed within a year. Speaker Z.Enkhbold gave a speech for the opening, emphasizing the importance of the opening ceremony and the first freight rail line established from Turmurtei mine to the Khandgait railway station. While pointing to a poster behind him which read “Mongolians Will Develop Mongolia”, he said, “This is the slogan of the Darkhan Metallurgical Plant. Large development projects in Mongolia were completed with assistance from foreign companies many decades ago. Foreigners used to doubt that Mongolians could do it by themselves. Today’s development work was completed by Mongolians. It is actual proof that we can do develop on our own.” Afterwards, Speaker Z.Enkhbold reviewed operations at the Tumurtei mine station. He expressed full confidence that infrastructure would improve and more people would live and establish commerce around the area following the opening of the new railway station. A video conferencing system was installed at the station as well. Advising Engineer of Mongolian Resources Corporation O.Dorjsugar noted that it was the second video conferencing system installed in Mongolia, enabling provincial administrators to hold online conferences. The Mongolian Resources Corporation was in charge of installing railway signals in addition to the video conferencing system. MTZ plans to transport a million tons of iron ore this year and aims to increase transportation volume by eight to 10 tons in the future.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19092
Gobi Wolf 2016 disaster preparedness exercise commences	By M.OYUNGEREL Gobi Wolf 2016, a U.S. and Mongolian exercise focused on training for earthquake-readiness, commenced on April 4. Over 100 people from the U.S. Embassy in Mongolia, the U.S. Army Pacific, Mongolian Ministry of Defense, the National Emergency Management Agency, and international relief agencies participated in the Pacific Resilience Disaster Response Exercise and Exchange program initiative, which took place in Ulaanbaatar and Orkhon-Uul Province. Researchers have identified Ulaanbaatar and Orkhon-Uul Province as high-risk seismic zones in Mongolia. Ulaanbaatar is located at the junction of two highly active seismic activity zones. Due to blasts that take place every Wednesday and Friday at Orkhon-Uul Province’s Erdenet ore processing factory, the center of the province regularly experiences vibrations, adding to earthquake damage risk potential. This year’s Gobi Wolf focused on strengthening and enhancing national and local disaster management plans, earthquake preparedness plans, civil-military cooperation management during a natural disaster, and the country’s ability to respond to international humanitarian assistance and recover from an emergency situation. Gobi Wolf, which has been organized since 2009, is a civil-military initiative that focuses on regional readiness in response to natural and man-made disasters. Gobi Wolf identifies the best practices and lessons learned across the humanitarian assistance and disaster relief spectrum.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19119
Thousands of empty shoes stand in for protesters	By E.OYUNDARI Mongolian Youth Federation (MYF) is continuing its national Thief-free Mongolia Movement and held “Shoe Protest” at Chinggis Square yesterday. Empty pairs of shoes were placed on the ground to address an issue or suggestion, reflecting the MYF’s concerns about human rights and current events. Thousands of students and youth have joined the Thief-free Mongolia Movement to express their views on social and political issues. The Mongolian Youth Federation published a list of 100 “black” events that have occurred in Mongolia since 1992, events which the MYF believes have threatened national security and ideology, the interests of the nation and region, the environment, and social values. Through the movement the MYF says it hopes to eliminate existing inequality in today’s society and to shape a responsible Mongolia with no thieves or hypocrites active in politics. During the protest, the President of the MYF said, “Today I am officially announcing the list of 100 black events that have occurred in Mongolia since 1992. I call on the nation to not elect thieves and hypocrites who have initiated, been involved in, and carried out these 100 happenings in the 2016 parliamentary and local elections. “Many people have the same position as us, however, they are not letting their position be known out of fear. Around 3,000 pairs of shoes were collected within a couple of hours. Every pair of shoes has its own rights, and every shoe has something to say. Behind every pair of shoes there is its owner. Today, Mongolian society is under fear and the state is hindering citizens’ rights to state their opinion. That’s why the shoes’ owners did not arrive in person.” General coordinator of the National Center Against Disaster J.Ganbaatar joined the protest. He said, “I am including my favorite boots in the shoe protest. I was wearing these shoes three years ago when I entered a landfill for radioactive waste. I have not worn these since then, and they still have mud remains stuck to them. I wanted to use my boots to warn people about the danger of uranium that is knocking on Mongolia’s doors.” One protestor said that he joined the protest to let politicians know that the nation has the right to impeach MPs, as the nation elects politicians to represent the voters of the nation. He said, “The protest can be carried out without chaos, expressing thoughts in a peaceful way is also important.”	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19156
Public transportation companies demand payment from UB authorities	By Ch.KHALIUN Public transportation providers are demanding that Ulaanbaatar leadership issue the payment of expenditures for the first quarter of 2016. Since Saturday, buses have been displaying a sign that reads, “Ulaanbaatar Mayor, give us payment for first quarter expenses. We will distribute salaries and pay off our debts.” Bus drivers explained that because payment for the first quarter has not been resolved, the public transportation companies have gone into debt to pay for fuel. They underlined that an unpleasant relationship has developed between fuel importing companies and the public transportation sector.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19206
Corruption investigation of MP Kh.Battulga erupts in controversy	By M.OYUNGEREL The Independent Authority Against Corruption (IAAC) and the Division against Economic Crimes at the Criminal Police Department is investigating MP Kh.Battulga on suspicions of organized money laundering, and conducted a five-hour search at the offices of two of his companies at Bayangol Hotel Office building, where news outlets, MPs, celebrity athletes, and others gathered outside the building in protest against the investigation. The IAAC and police officers conducted searches at the offices of Tumen Khishgten, a company founded to build a Chinggis Khan monument and tourist destination, and Bayalgiin Khuvi, an infrastructure investment company. News.mn reported that MP Kh.Battulga was with MPs L.Erdenechimeg and D.Ganbat and journalist L.Munkhbayasgalan when police officers entered his office at approximately 3:00 p.m. MP L.Erdenechimeg said that Kh.Battulga’s assistant had been arrested the previous morning, on April 10. Five armed special police officers began guarding the Bayangol Hotel Office entrance at approximately 4:00 p.m. and oversaw entry and exit. The special police force allegedly demanded that the companies’ employees turn their phones off to cut off outside communication concerning the investigation. MPs J.Batzandan, B.Garamgaibaatar, G.Uyanga, and M.Zorigt were joined by Mayor E.Bat-Uul outside of the building, saying they saw news of the investigation on social media. While journalists and cameras not already in the building were not permitted inside, many news outlets quickly gathered outside the entrance to report on developments in the story and reports were being broadcast live on television and online. MP J.Batzandan said, “The police investigation is getting out of hand. I have information that they’re conducting an illegal investigation. All investigations must abide by the law. I came here to see the investigation process.” MP B.Garamgaibaatar said there was nothing else they could do except watch the investigation being carried out. “The arrival of Members of Parliament doesn’t create an advantage. We can’t make any statements now because we don’t know what’s going on,” said B.Garamgaibaatar. Mayor E.Bat-Uul tried to enter the building but was denied access. After leaving the building at 4:56 p.m., Advisor to the Speaker of the Parliament on Mortgage and Construction Affairs and General Secretary of the Mongolian Democratic Union G.Baigalmaa said she believed the investigative procedures were directly related to the election. “This might even be related to disabling the MP’s right to run for office,” G.Baigalmaa said. Rumors spread that Mongolian Democratic Union members were going to be arrested in connection to a case involving the alleged misappropriation of funds for the construction of new railway. MP G.Baigalmaa drew a connection to the arrest of MP Kh.Battulga’s former assistant, G.Tuvshinjargal. “This is all for political purposes. You can see, investigate, and check whether we laundered the money; everything’s open in the media. You all saw Tuvshinjargal getting arrested. She was held in custody for 13 days but was released without being interrogated once. If we had really committed a crime, there was enough time to come up with evidence,” said G.Baigalmaa. Kh.Battulga’s daughter B.Namuun said, “We’re just really living in a society where the law is no longer the law. They said they were only going to conduct a search. Then, what a big car they brought. Everyone who has opened their mouths about Oyu Tolgoi is being pressured. The reason behind all this is obvious. It’s probably methods to make him not participate in the election.” People who introduced themselves as the first members of the Mongolian Democratic Union, as well as athletes led by Mongolian Judo Association coach O.Baljinnyam and Olympic judo medalist N.Tuvshinbayar, gathered outside the Bayangol Hotel Office. Judoka Kh.Tsagaanbaatar said the athletes were afraid for sports officials who were in the building and	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19235
Mongolia and Russia sign mid-term program agreement to develop strategic partnership	By E.OYUNDARI Foreign Affairs Minister of the Russian Federation Sergey Viktorovich Lavrov arrived at Chinggis Khaan International Airport on Wednesday morning to conduct an official visit upon the invitation of Foreign Affairs Minister of Mongolia L.Purevsuren. As a part of the visit, the counterparts signed a mid-term program agreement for the development of a strategic partnership between Mongolia and Russia. Noting that strategic partnership relations are actively developing and the frequency of high-level talks is stabilizing, the counterparts shared views on current regional and global problems and discussed key issues of bilateral cooperation in various multilateral formats. Minister Lavrov said that the program agreement is comprehensive and geared to overcome issues concerning bilateral economic ties that have gone unresolved in recent years, to further expand cooperation in the political, trade, economic, humanitarian, and international spheres. Prime Minister Ch.Saikhanbileg also received Sergey Lavrov. Emphasizing that Mongolia-Russia relations in trade and economy have advanced in the past two years, Ch.Saikhanbileg thanked Russia for its support and contributions to the relations of two countries. “Now we have no legal obstacles to resume credit relations between Russia and Mongolia, Foreign Ministers Sergey Lavrov and L.Purevsuren signing program agreement such a possibility is currently under discussion,” Lavrov said when asked about the possibility of Russia providing loans to Mongolia. Earlier this year, Russia ratified a law to write off Mongolia’s 174 million USD debt to Russia. The debt was a major obstacle for establishing deeper cooperation between the two countries. This is the second visit by Lavrov to Mongolia, and was conducted as the nations prepare to mark the 95th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19272
Health officials report 59 children have died from measles in 2016	By M.OYUNGEREL Representatives from the Ministry of Health and Sports, the National Center for Communicable Diseases, and the National Center for Maternal and Children’s Health of Mongolia, led by the Ministry’s State Secretary S.Lambaa, held a press conference on April 15, stating that 59 children have died from measles in 2016, not 918 as reported on social media. At the beginning of the press conference, S.Lambaa said, “In the last few years, child mortality has decreased through the Mongolian government’s sustainable policy. For instance, the mortality rate of children under five was at 87.5 percent in every 1,000 births. In 2010, the number decreased to 20 percent, and to 18.3 percent in 2015. We have completed the Millennium Development Goal to decrease the mortality of children under five by four times. With this number, Mongolia has been listed as one of nine countries to have successfully implemented the UN’s Millennium Development Goals.” He added that the mortality of children under one was at 63.4 percent in 1990, and has decreased to 15.3 percent as of 2015. Deputy Minister Ts.Oyunbaatar said that 491 children under five died in the first three months of 2016. He said the information that 918 children under five have died from measles is inaccurate. “In the first three months of 2016, 491 children under the age of five have died, 427 of which were children under one. Child mortality has increased by 120 compared to last year,” he said. Of the total number of children who have died from measles, 76.2 percent were zero to eight months old and had not been vaccinated; 70 percent were children diagnosed with comorbidity due to the presence of chronic diseases, rachitis (commonly known as rickets), malnutrition, anemia, immune system disorders, and leukemia; 96.8 percent had pneumonia at the time they contracted measles; and 3.2 percent had laryngitis. Prime Minister Ch.Saikhanbileg and S.Lambaa visited the National Center for Communicable Diseases (NCCD) on April 15 and met with health sector administrators, doctors from emergency and intensive care units, and the parents of children being hospitalized. Currently, 18 people are being treated in the intensive care unit at the NCCD. Two months ago 350 million MNT was spent from government aid funds to purchase hospital equipment for the NCCD. The equipment, including one incubator, 12 monitors, four medical ventilators, 12 automated syringes, 13 automated intravenous pumps, and a defibrillator, arrived on April 14 and is now being installed in the intensive care unit. NCCD administrators said the new equipment will solve the equipment shortage problem. “We ordered the equipment to reach medical care standards, such as providing one ventilator for every 10 beds,” said S.Lambaa. The parents of children being hospitalized at the NCCD stressed that there were not enough doctors and nurses at the center. “Nurses from intensive care units at other hospitals can’t work at ours, as they’re not specially trained, but we have increased the number of our staff. Currently, 45 to 50 nurses are working the night shift, compared to the 25 who normally work the night shift. “Giving the staff’s overtime payments around October leads to a lot of complaints, but we have started giving the overtime payments on time, which increases the staff’s enthusiasm and motivation,” said the Head of the National Center for Communicable Diseases, D.Nyamkhuu. He added that the center has opened a lounge for the patient caretakers upon request. Prime Minister Ch.Saikhanbileg ordered the Ministry of Health and Sports and Ulaanbaatar and province administrators to offer at-home medical examinations for children eight months old and younger until July 1. “It’s right to tell the children’s parents to keep their children at home, as doctors will examine them by visiting their homes,” said Ch.Saikhanbileg. The PM encouraged state and private organizations to permit paid leave to staff with children under one 	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19321
Mongolia-India ties strengthen with Lok Sabha Speaker’s visit	By E.OYUNDARI Speaker of the Indian Parliament’s Lower House, the Lok Sabha, Sumitra Mahajan arrived in Ulaanbaatar to attend the 9th Asia-Europe Parliamentary Partnership Meeting, and held bilateral talks with her Mongolian counterpart yesterday. Z.Enkhbold, Speaker of the Parliament of Mongolia, officially welcomed Speaker Mahajan at Chinggis Square yesterday. Shortly after the welcoming ceremony, the counterparts signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on cooperation between the State Great Khural and the Lok Sabha. Under the inter-parliamentary MoU, the legal grounds for inter-parliamentary cooperation have been strengthened, and the two nations believe that pleasant conditions are being created to expand future collaboration. The signed document is also a step toward Mongolia and India offering each other mutual support in the international and regional arenas. Beginning official talks, Speaker Z.Enkhold underlined that Speaker Mahajan’s visit was the first official visit from a high-level Indian official since the relations of two countries were upgraded to a strategic partnership at the end of 2015. Mahajan noted that relations and collaboration between the two countries have been developed and enriched in recent years with new forms of collaboration. She added that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Mongolia in 2015 was a significant event in the history of bilateral relations between Mongolia and India. “The Mongolia-India relations and cooperation, based on historical and cultural ties, on common values of democracy, on bilateral aspiration to keep regional and international peace and stability, have been intensively developing under the strategic partnership principle,” noted Z.Enkhbold. He noted that the very first visit of the Indian Prime Minister to Mongolia in 2015, conducted on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations, brought bilateral cooperation in information technology, renewable energy, industry, agriculture, culture, and education to a new stage. Speaker Z.Enkhbold pointed out that the Mongolian Foreign Affairs Minister plans to pay a visit to India later this month to sign a general credit agreement for a one billion USD soft loan granted by India, adding that Mongolian Parliament is to discuss authorization of the signing of the government’s agreement this week. Speaker Mahajan noted that one of the main policy directions of India is to support Mongolia in all spheres, noting that Mongolia is a model democracy in Asia. Mentioning Mongolia’s natural resources and India’s highly developed technology, she underlined that India and Mongolia have great cooperation opportunities if the sides collaborate to combine the countries’ resources. Noting the contribution of bilateral high-level visits in the development of cooperation between legislative bodies and bilateral relations, Speaker Z.Enkhbold stated that India’s policy to support landlocked countries such as Mongolia is significant. He added that Mongolia is working on establishing the International Think-Tank for Landlocked Developing Countries in Ulaanbaatar. He expressed Mongolia’s willingness to boost mutually beneficial and sustainable cooperation in economy and trade with India. The Speaker emphasized the importance of the Mongolia-India cooperation committee in terms of designing the framework for trade and economic collaboration, as well as its proper directions and forms, and for supporting ties between the nations’ private sectors. Speaker Z.Enkhbold congratulated India on strengthening its reputation and influence in the world and in the region, and said Mongolia wants to maintain a tradition of strengthening cooperation between the two nations within the UN and other international and regional organizations. Speaker Mahajan echoed Z.Enkhbold’s hopes for bilateral cooperation in multiple spheres, and said that India has prioritized the development of its remote regions in recent years, and noted that India’s exper	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19349

Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso exhibition coming to Ulaanbaatar	By B.DULGUUN The Ulaanbaatar City Council is organizing the first-ever exhibition of original artwork by Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso in Ulaanbaatar, as part of the Friendly Ulaanbaatar Program, with cooperation from the Fine Arts Zanabazar Museum. Art collector and Russian entrepreneur Alexander Shadrin approached the city council with a proposal to display his collection of artwork by Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso at the Fine Arts Zanabazar Museum. The exhibition will be on view from April 29 to May 29, and will feature sculptures, paintings, drawings, and ceramics by the two prominent artists, created during the peak of their careers. Authorities believe that the exhibition will draw in many visitors eager to view the original work of these two world famous artists. The Fine Arts Zanabazar Museum proposed that the Ulaanbaatar City Council offer its support by providing the 5.7 million MNT required for renting glass display cases to house the sculptures and ceramics, and in publishing a catalog for the exhibition. After a meeting of museum and city officials, the city council agreed to support the exhibition as it supports the goals of the Friendly Ulaanbaatar Program and will enrich the city’s artistic resources, as well as give tourists and local residents the opportunity to view pieces by world renowned artists. “Seeing remarkable, world famous artwork with your own eyes feels incredible. I believe it will be a very nice gift to people who enjoy classic artwork and paintings,” said E.Bat-Uul, Mayor of Ulaanbaatar. The owner of the collection has negotiated earnings from entrance fees for the exhibition, but says he will donate a portion of the income to the Fine Arts Zanabazar Museum.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=19432
OYU TOLGOI AND MONGOLIA TO TACKLE POWER ISSUES IN SOUTH GOBI	Oyu Tolgoi LLC signed a power sector cooperation agreement (PSCA) with the government for energy supply in the southern region of the country last week. The agreement lays out a framework for long-term strategic cooperation between the Mongolian government and Oyu Tolgoi to deliver a comprehensive energy plan for the South Gobi region. The main objective of the agreement is an international tender process to identify and select an independent power provider to privately fund, construct, own, and operate a power plant to supply electricity, with Oyu Tolgoi as the primary consumer. Minister M.Sonompil said, “Successful implementation of the PSCA will add significant domestic power capacity, strengthening Mongolia’s energy supply network. It will also encourage investment and jobs – both during construction and in operation.” The government said on its website that Oyu Tolgoi will provide support in finding financial backers for the southern region energy project from international banks and financial organizations. Prime Minister N.Altankhuyag participated in the official signing ceremony at the State House, where Minister of Energy M.Sonompil and Head of the Energy Regulatory Commission S.Otgonbayar, on behalf of the government, and Chairman of the Oyu Tolgoi board G.Batsukh and President and CEO Craig Kinnell, on behalf of Oyu Tolgoi LLC, signed the PSCA. The agreement was signed amid a tax dispute between the government and Oyu Tolgoi. The Tax Authority of Mongolia made a claim for 130 million USD in unpaid taxes earlier this year, which put a stop to Oyu Tolgoi’s four billion USD underground development phase, which was set to start this year. The parties said that they are still in discussions regarding the issues and hope to reach a solution before the deadline for commitments from underground development financiers. “The PSCA is a positive development for Oyu Tolgoi. It demonstrates how we and the government can work together to achieve shared objectives-in this case, developing a long-term, economically competitive, and reliable power supply in the South Gobi,” said Jean-Sebastien Jacques, chief executive of Rio Tinto Copper, which owns 66 percent of Oyu Tolgoi through its unit, Turquoise Hill Resources. Full evaluation of the independent power producer option is expected to take nine to 12 months. By B.KHASH-ERDENE	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=11417
Security ramped up for Chinese President’s visit	Mongolian security officials began ramping up security across Ulaanbaatar on Monday with the impending visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping. In a press release, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the Chinese President was due to discuss bilateral matters on Thursday. However the UB Post could not confirm rumors prior to deadline that the Chinese President’s visit is set to begin a day earlier than both Mongolian and Chinese officials had announced. However, major multi-use venues Blue Sky and Monnis Towers confirmed that they were advised by police not to open windows facing the State Palace on August 20 and 21. Sources in the Chingeltei District Police Department confirmed that security has been heightened since Monday. He noted that during high level official visits, the police typically heighten security on the day of the visit, and that the police are taking on more work during this particular visit. Mongolia and China enjoy an officially diplomatic if complicated historical relationship, further complicated by anti-Chinese sentiment common in some sectors of Mongolia society and politics. With increased trade, boosted after the free market and democratic revolution of 1989, Mongolia’s dependence on China for consumer goods jumped radically, which some see as cause for concern for Mongolian national security and independence. China’s state-sponsored People’s Daily describes the relationship between the two countries as one of “constant progress” since the revised signing of the Treaty on Friendly Relations and Cooperation in 1994. President Ts.Elbegdorj has been particularly keen on reshaping the image of Mongolia’s southern neighbor to the public, for which he has received both criticism and praise. Bilateral relations have improved as the nations increased high level dialogues in recent months. President Ts.Elbegdorj visited China in May for a regional security summit, which was followed by visits from Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in June, and Vice-President Li Yuanchao in April. The last visit of a Chinese president to Mongolia occurred eleven years ago in 2003, with the visit of then President Hu Jintao. During the visit, officials are expected to draw up a series of energy and infrastructure deals, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The deals will cover the construction of two coal-to-gas plants that will supply up to 95 percent of its output to China. Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Jianchao told the South China Morning Post that the two countries would also sign deals on coal mining and infrastructure. The UB Post will provide coverage of President Xi Jinping’s visit in our next edition. By Khash-Erdene	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=11456
Minister Ts.Oyungerel: Bat’s defamation charge is a threat to democracy and free expression	Minister of Culture Ts.Oyungerel has issued a scathing assessment of the recent libel case which saw her brother, Ts. Bat, imprisoned for some three months for criticizing Transport Minister A.Gansukh on Twitter. In an exclusive interview with the UB Post, the Culture Minister blasted Minister Gansukh for what she sees as a significant threat to Mongolian democratic values. ”[This case] gives a very bad message about Mongolia … We have democracy, we have human rights, that all countries are struggling for. But if we lose it from within, what will we turn into? It is very bad news for Mongolian citizens, for Mongolia’s future, for Mongolian democracy.” The minister highlighted a significant deficit in legal protection for those who come forward. “I think that this [case] shows that Mongolia doesn’t have any protection for whistleblowers,” she said. “It’s because of the deficits in the protections of our citizens, this is our misjudgment… My brother is a professional engineer who had a twenty-year long career in Mongolian aviation. That’s why he knows what’s happening in Mongolian aviation, and if he doesn’t like something, he will express it.” Minister Oyungerel believes the case was politically motivated. “If I list all the punishments that (Bat) received over the course of the past two years, we can say that it was political,” she says. “Imprisonment is just a culmination of what is happening between the whistleblower and the Minister.” Both the Culture and Transport ministers have come into conflict in the past as a result of her longstanding opposition to the privatization of MIAT, a policy then led by the Transport Minister. “When the Minister of Transport rallied strongly to privatize MIAT a few years ago, I was his main opposition in the Parliament,” said Minister Oyungerel. The minister expressed dismay that her brother received a harsher-than-expected sentence. “I was so shocked to hear that it was imprisonment,” she said. “I didn’t attend the court hearing, but I did attend the reading of the court verdict. So when the judge read the verdict, she said that the State Prosecutor wanted to issue a fine… But the judge said, ‘but because Bat is unemployed, I order imprisonment.’ The lower your social status, the harsher the punishment – that was the logic in that verdict.” The minister described the case as “unequal”, with Minister Gansukh using his government position as a means of leverage. “I’m also shocked that the minister filed his complaint on his ministry’s letterhead – with the stamp of the Ministry – so that gives him an unequal power against a citizen,” Oyungerel said, “a citizen who doesn’t have a job, or doesn’t have other status, and doesn’t have government protection. So I think there’s an unequal fight going on, with power being used against citizens’ freedom, and I, of course, stand with citizens’ rights.” Ts.Bat had been on medical leave when he was fired for speaking out against Gansukh, and his health is frail, according to his sister. “[Bat] is worried about his health, as he has a very strict dietary regime. That regime is now gone because of the prison regime… His condition will quickly deteriorate… His attorney asked if he could be placed in the prison hospital. Today (on Wednesday) I heard that he was moved there.” Support has emerged online for Bat’s release, with small protests from the local Twitter community taking place in Chinggis Khan Square earlier in the week, and the hashtag “#FreeBat” receiving increased mentions online. “Since when is social network deemed as press media. Which law mentions this? #FreeBat,” said Twitter user @iTulga. “If a minister’s sibling Bat engineer is arrested, some nobody like us will just go hoop #FreeBAT,” said another, @BaagiiJr Local free expression advocates also expressed their dismay at the ruling. Khashkhuu Naranjargal, executive director of Globe International, described the case as “a brutal action… completely against freedom of expression standards an	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=11516
Summary of President Xi Jinping’s state visit to Mongolia	Chinese President Xi Jinping, his wife Peng Liyuan, and other official Chinese representatives paid a two-day state visit to Mongolia from August 21 to 22, at the invitation of Mongolian President Ts.Elbegdorj. President Ts.Elbegdorj welcomed the Chinese representatives: “I extend to Your Excellencies President Xi Jinping and Mrs. Peng Liyuang, and distinguished guests, my sincere welcome to Mongolia during this historic visit, which heralds a new page in bilateral relations between our countries.” During the visit, approximately 30 agreements, memoranda and contracts were signed between the governments, government authorities, enterprises and companies, namely for issues concerning the economy, trade and transport sectors, and upgrading Mongolia-China bilateral relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership. “Great things may be done by mass effort. China is willing to provide the opportunity and space for common development with neighboring countries, including Mongolia, so that they may benefit from China’s development,” stated the Chinese President. At the State Ceremonial Ger, the two presidents had a private conversation, where the Mongolian President made several propositions for cooperation in the production and gasification of coal, increasing the number of goods from Asia to Europe passing through Mongolia to 100 million tons by 2020, enhancing transit railway performance for Russia, Mongolia and China, and support for Mongolia’s bid to join APEC. He also emphasized tax-free and unlimited export of goods, especially those from the agricultural sector. In response, President Xi Jinping agreed to take the propositions into consideration, guaranteed to support Mongolia’s membership in APEC, and invited President Ts.Elbegdorj to partake in APEC’s high level meeting in China in September. The Chinese side also mentioned their willingness to cooperate in the energy sector by partnering the construction and operation of a coal power plant and importing coal, and showed interest in signing a Russia-Mongolia-China transit transport agreement and developing a China-Mongolia-Europe transit transport system. On the final day of his two-day state visit to Mongolia, Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered a speech to a special session of the Mongolian parliament, underlining that Mongolia-China relations had entered their best period in history and pointing out the significance of signing a comprehensive strategic partnership, the peak of bilateral relations. Mongolian President Ts.Elbegdorj, MPs, Head of the Diplomatic Corps, and other Mongolian officials, as well as the Chinese delegation, were present at the special parliamentary session. Analysts say the first state visit in 11 years by the head of the Chinese state to Mongolia contributed considerably to solving many issues concerning sea ports, new routes for railway, the trade volume of commodities, duration of agreements and facilitations, and created an opportunity for the two presidents to exchange views on a broad range of international and regional issues of mutual interest.

Nearly 550 billion MNT required for building flood protection dams	By Ch.KHALIUN Officials underline that 548 billion MNT is necessary for building drainage and flood protection systems to prevent UB residents from suffering damages caused by flooding. According to the flood hazard study, households living near the basin of the Selbe River are in danger of being impacted by flooding first. General Manager of Ulaanbaatar B.Badral emphasized that a defensive strategy needs to be implemented in order to prevent flood risk. He added that approximately 550 billion MNT will need to be invested for building flood protection dams. As of July 19, the water level of the Orkhon River increased by 45 to 55 cm in a single day, exceeding flood levels by 10 to 40 cm near Ulziit and Kharkhorin soums. Water levels around estuaries of the Ongi River rose by 85 cm and exceeded flood levels by 5 cm. As of yesterday, flood levels near the Orkhon, Old Orkhin, Khovd, Buyant, Baidrag and Ongi rivers are exceeding limits. State and province officials have called on herders settled near these river basins, people celebrating provincial Naadam festivals, and businesses and tourists to be alert and cautious of flooding hazards.	http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=15356
Amgalan Power Plant to provide heat and energy soon	By Ch.Khaliun The Cabinet resolved financing of 3.9 billion MNT necessary for test heating through the plant’s network. The PM instructed Chairman of Development Bank N.Munkhbat to immediately transfer the funds, and Chairman of Mongolian Customs B.Tsengel to expand the temporary customs procedures period and eliminate taxes for two trucks that will transport ash from the facility. Authorities of the Ministry of Roads and Transportation, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Energy were tasked with immediately obtaining substitute locomotives for coal transportation. UB Mayor E.Bat-Uul was made responsible for taking measures to relocate more than ten households that are adjacent to the plant’s fence and directly interfere with the activities of the plant. The Office of Media and Public Relations of the Cabinet reported that the PM emphasized the necessity for intensifying winter preparedness and allowing UB residents to comfortably overcome winter. News.mn spoke with Minister of Energy D.Zorigt regarding the new thermal power plant. How many complaints are delivered to the Energy Ministry regarding poor power and heat supply? Due to increased population and settlement in UB, heat distribution is becoming inefficient. Many citizens and entities address the Ministry regarding this issue. We don’t have such options to provide heat everywhere, but commissioning the Amgalan plant will improve the situation, providing heat to households living in the eastern side of the city. The workload of the central heating system will decrease as well through the commissioning of the eastern heating network. Problems for households near Zaisan with heat supply deficiencies will be resolved. How about the winter preparedness of the energy sector? Winter preparedness and extensive maintenance work is in progress. Over 1,400 projects will be complete according to the data. Currently, winter preparedness is ongoing at 50 percent completion. Recently, changes were made to the energy tariffs, and the law on energy has been amended. Now it provides the opportunity for the central and eastern region power systems to work without any financial losses for the first time. I see that revenue can cover expenses now. While the western and southern regions will still work at a loss, it is because of imported energy from foreign countries. In the future we will liberalize the tariffs and policies of the energy sector. On the other hand, we do believe that following a flexible policy for households with low income and low power consumption will mitigate the sector’s losses in the next few years. We are regulating price tariffs in order to lower inefficiency. We will save over 15 billion MNT in expenses, tightening our belt, and mitigating the sector’s losses by the end of this year. The price of energy from Russia is increasing. Will the increase continue in the future? Because we import energy from foreign countries, we negotiate on their proposed prices. Unfortunately the price is increasing every six months. However, we need to import energy in the next few years. We need to commission our own energy resources as soon as possible. Rumors were going around about privatizing energy companies? They won’t be fully privatized, but made public. They will be able to raise additional shares at the stock exchange and investors and individuals can buy shares. In other words, they will work as open joint stock companies. Can citizens overcome winter without worry after the commissioning of the Amgalan plant? We are ensuring necessary preparedness to provide consumers with reliable energy this winter.
